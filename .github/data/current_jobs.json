We are seeking experienced software engineers to build analytical frameworks and tools that empower internal users to construct quantitative analysis pipelines and develop metrics. These metrics will support and accelerate feature design, prioritization, and development, as well as evaluate the impact of recently released features. Our analytics framework equally supports road event monitoring, data mining and training, and simulation metrics.\n\nAbout the Organization: The Simulation, Evaluation, and Data organization is dedicated to advancing the development of autonomous vehicles through cutting-edge simulation technologies. The Metrics Frameworks team within this organization focuses on creating, maintaining, and evolving the analytics framework that supports GM's goal of safe, high-performing, and scalable driverless technology. The team delivers robust and scalable tools that facilitate data-driven decision-making throughout the AV feature development lifecycle. We collaborate closely with Simulation Evaluation, Embodied AI, and System and Test Engineering teams to enhance productivity across the organization by developing automation tools and shared libraries for all engineering teams. We are accountable for the performance, reliability, and scalability OKRs of the analytics framework. This includes, but is not limited to, developing customized analytics workflows, improving operational telemetry and dashboards to track relevant KPIs for prioritization, and identifying, designing, and implementing solutions to achieve key results.\n\nWhat You’ll Do:\n• Create tooling that can receive signals from various sources (Simulation, Road, etc) and allow users to easily build quantitative analysis pipelines to extract usable insights.\n• Accelerate team’s effectiveness and efficiency by designing and implementing scalable automation tools for test creation, data collection and analysis, debugging, and performance monitoring.\n• Design and implement extensible and well-tested shared libraries that will be used by many engineers across the organization.\n• Collaborate with other frameworks and data infra teams to build and deploy tools to improve productivity.\n• Work closely with autonomous vehicle engineering to enable rapid development and model feedback.\n• Maintain a high technical standard for code quality on the team, through architectural design and code reviews.\n\nYour Skills & Abilities:\n• Experience developing scalable software solutions that will be used by many developers\n• Experience writing Python and C++ in a production environment (unit testing, code review, algorithm performance and tradeoffs, etc.)\n• Experience developing automation scripts (Python and Bash scripts)\n• BS in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or Aerospace Engineering\n• 5+ years of industry experience\n• Strong organizational and communication skills\n\nWhat Will Give You A Competitive Edge:\n• Experience with SQL and related tools/tech (Big Query, DuckDB, etc)\n• Experience with time-series data analysis and online performance monitoring tools\n• Experience building high performance framework / infrastructure and performance optimization in C++/Python\n• Familiarity with ROS, Pandas, Python bindings for C++, and plotting/visualization libraries\n• Familiarity with Data orchestration and transformation tools like AirTable, AirFlow, DBT, etc\n\nCompensation : The salary range for this role is ($129,000 and $198,400). The actual base salary a successful candidate will be offered within this range will vary based on factors relevant to the position.\n\nHybrid: This role is categorized as hybrid.

We design, deploy, and scale sophisticated agentic systems on our own private infrastructure. We are looking for a Senior AI Engineer who moves past \"prompt engineering\" to architect complex, stateful workflows where data security and hardware efficiency are the primary constraints. If you believe the future of AI belongs to those who own the weights and the silicon, you belong here.\n\nThe Role\n\nAs a Senior AI Engineer, you will own the end-to-end lifecycle of our internal AI ecosystem—from optimizing local inference engines to orchestrating multi-agent swarms. You will build systems that don't just \"chat,\" but reason, execute tools, and maintain state over long-running business processes. This is a role for a \"full-stack\" AI engineer: someone who understands both the mathematical foundations of LLMs and the systems engineering required to run them at scale on-premise.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n• Agentic Orchestration: Architect multi-agent systems using LangGraph or PydanticAI, implementing advanced patterns like Plan-and-Execute, Self-Reflection, and Multi-Agent Handoffs.\n• Production RAG: Build high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines utilizing hybrid search, cross-encoders, and re-ranking within our private vector stores.\n• On-Premise Optimization: Manage the full inference stack. You will be responsible for optimizing model performance (latency vs. throughput) on local GPU clusters using vLLM, TGI, or TensorRT-LLM.\n• Stateful Architecture: Design resilient workflows that handle long-running tasks, error recovery, and complex \"human-in-the-loop\" interactions.\n• Evaluation & Benchmarking: Develop rigorous, automated \"LLM-as-a-judge\" frameworks to evaluate agentic performance, ensuring reliability and grounding.\n\nTechnical Requirements\n• Agentic Frameworks: Expert-level mastery of LangGraph (state machines/persistence) or PydanticAI (type-safe logic/structured outputs).\n• Python Mastery: Deep experience in asynchronous Python and building scalable, production-grade backend services (FastAPI, Pydantic).\n• Infrastructure & Deployment: Proven experience deploying open-weights models (Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek) on bare-metal or private Kubernetes environments.\n• The \"Inner Workings\": A strong grasp of LLM fundamentals, including attention mechanisms, KV caching, and the impact of tokenization on performance/cost.\n\nNice to Have (The Extra Mile)\n\nThis role is specifically for engineers who enjoy the challenge of hardware constraints and model ownership:\n• Model Training & Refinement: Experience with the full training lifecycle:\n• Pretraining: Knowledge of data curation, pruning, and continued pretraining on domain-specific datasets.\n• Post-training: Hands-on experience with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and alignment techniques like DPO, ORPO, or RLHF.\n• Model Compression & Efficiency: Deep knowledge of quantization (GGUF, AWQ, EXL2), model distillation, and graph optimization to squeeze maximum performance out of local hardware.\n• VRAM Management: Ability to perform \"VRAM math\"—calculating memory requirements for various model sizes (e.g., 70B vs 8B) relative to context window length, batch sizes, and KV cache pressure.\n• Data Sovereignty: A passion for building private systems where data privacy and infrastructure control are paramount.\n\nJob Type: Full-time\n\nPay: $5,000.00 - $7,000.00 per month\n\nBenefits:\n• Paid time off\n\nWork Location: In person",
