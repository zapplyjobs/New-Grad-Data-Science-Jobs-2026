We manage large-scale, multi-tenant LLM inference across major cloud providers and build platform services to support these workloads. We also provide VectorDB/RAG services and MCP services that make AI workloads secure, observable, and cost-efficient for product teams.\n\nOn top of this foundation, we deliver agentic frameworks, SDKs, tools, and evaluation/guardrail capabilities that help teams quickly build reliable GenAI assistants and automation features. You’ll join a group that sits at the intersection of distributed systems, ML, and developer experience, grounded in operational excellence and a culture of impact-driven, cross-functional collaboration.\n\nYour Impact\n• Lead the end-to-end architecture for key areas of the AI Platform: multi-tenant LLM serving (vLLM/Ray), routing and orchestration layers, VectorDB/RAG integration, and agentic/SDK surfaces used by product teams.\n• Design and drive implementation of high-scale inference services, including parallelism strategies (TP/PP/EP/MoE), autoscaling policies, and cross-region capacity management for GPU/CPU workloads.\n• Optimize latency, throughput, and cost for large-scale LLM and generative workloads using techniques such as batching, chunked prefills, caching, and mixed precision.\n• Design and tune distributed inference configurations (TP/PP/EP/MoE), across multi-GPU and multi-node clusters and modern GPU architectures.\n• Implement platform capabilities such as telemetry, metering & throttling, guardrails, and rollout/rollback to ensure AI services are safe, observable, and multi-tenant by default.\n• Lead the design of GenAI application services—chat assistants, and automation APIs, grounded in robust RAG pipelines, agentic workflows (LangChain/LangGraph or similar), and MCP-based tool ecosystems.\n• Drive operational excellence with runbooks, readiness checklists, CI/CD safeguards, on-call rotations, and post-incident improvements.\n• Provide technical mentorship and leadership for senior and mid-level engineers: review designs, guide trade-offs around quality/latency/COGS, and help grow the next generation of tech leads.\n• Collaborate closely with applied scientists to productionize new models and techniques, ensuring that research prototypes become robust, observable, and cost-efficient services.\n\nMinimum Qualifications:\n• Bachelor's degree in computer science, Engineering, or equivalent practical experience.\n• 8+ years of hands-on experience building and operating backend or distributed systems in production or 5+ years of experience with a Master’s degree, or 3+ years with a PhD\n• Proven track record as a technical lead for complex systems: driving architecture, aligning stakeholders, and delivering high-impact projects end-to-end.\n• Strong proficiency in at least one modern programming language (e.g., Python, Go, or Java) and deep experience with software design, debugging, and performance tuning.\n• Significant experience with cloud-native architectures (containers, Kubernetes, service discovery, configuration management, CI/CD) and building reliable microservices (REST/gRPC).\n• Demonstrated ownership of production services at scale, including on-call participation, incident response, and post-incident/RCAs that led to concrete improvements.\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n• Hands-on experience running LLM or deep learning inference at scale using frameworks such as vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, Triton Inference Server, or similar.\n• Deep understanding of GPU and distributed systems performance: latency/throughput trade-offs, pipelining, model parallelism (TP/PP/EP/MoE), mixed precision (BF16/FP8/nvFP4), and profiling tools.\n• Experience designing and operating RAG systems and GenAI application layers: document ingestion, chunking/embedding strategies, metadata design, hybrid retrieval, context ranking, and evaluation of retrieval quality.\n• Practical experience with agentic frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, or similar) and multi-agent coordination, including integration with MCP tools and internal/external APIs.\n• Background building platform or Developer experiences capabilities—shared services, SDKs, templates, micro-frontends—that are adopted by multiple product teams.\n• Familiarity with LangSmith or similar evaluation platforms, including experiment design, offline/online evals, hallucination/groundedness metrics, and feedback loops.\n• Strong knowledge of AWS or Azure or GCP (EC2/VMs, IAM roles/ARNs/principals, VPC networking, security best practices) for AI workloads.\n• Experience defining and monitoring dashboards, and alerts for high-availability systems using Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud-native tooling.\n• Excellent communication and collaboration skills, comfortable influencing cross-functional partners and other senior engineers, and explaining trade-offs between quality, latency, and cost to both technical and non-technical audiences.\n\nWhy Cisco?\n\nAt Cisco, we’re revolutionizing how data and infrastructure connect and protect organizations in the AI era – and beyond.

Autonomy is now a data race–and Uber has an edge: We collect rare, real-world driving data at a scale and capital efficiency no one else can match (millions of Uber trips every hour across cities, conditions, and edge cases create the data autonomy has been missing). We will build platforms that harness scale and real-world complexity to reimagine how the world moves.\n\nYou will be an ML engineer in AV Labs conducting autonomous vehicle modeling and research, with an emphasis on developing foundational and applied techniques that shape the future of autonomous driving. The ideal candidate will formulate research problems, design and evaluate novel modeling approaches, and influence the direction of large-scale autonomous systems through strong scientific judgment and execution. You will work cross-functionally with engineers from AV Labs and partner engineering teams which enables Uber’s mission of helping people go anywhere and get anything and earn their way.\n\nWhat You Will Do:\n• Design and implement cutting-edge techniques for autonomous vehicle systems.\n• Collaborate closely with engineering teams and product teams across AV Labs to integrate modeling approaches into production pipelines.\n• Publish and present original research at top-tier CV and ML conferences.\n\nBasic Qualifications:\n• PhD or MS with equivalent industry experience in Computer Science, Robotics, or a related field.\n• Relevant experience in autonomous vehicles or computer vision, with a strong understanding of how research ideas connect to autonomous vehicle systems.\n• Demonstrated technical contributions, including publications at leading ML and CV conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ICLR, NeurIPS, or similar venues.\n• Proficiency in Python and modern deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow; experience with C++ or deploying models in production environments is a plus.\n• Strong communication skills and the ability to collaborate effectively with researchers and engineers across teams.\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n• Experience with autonomous vehicles research.\n• Hands-on experience in training multimodal LLMs for autonomous vehicle systems or relevant computer vision systems.\n• Recent publications in one or more of the following areas: 3D perception & scene understanding, multimodal embedding, diffusion models, gaussian splatting, vision language action models, and world models.\n• Experience with real-world product development and deployment.\n\nFor Sunnyvale, CA-based roles: The base salary range for this role is USD$171,000 per year - USD$190,000 per year.\n\nYou will be eligible to participate in Uber's bonus program, and may be offered an equity award & other types of comp. All full-time employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan. You will also be eligible for various benefits. More details can be found at the following link https://jobs.uber.com/en/benefits.\n\nUber's mission is to reimagine the way the world moves for the better.
