    "job_description": "We’re looking for a Data Science Summer Intern who’s excited to jump into some of the most interesting areas of AI today. You’ll spend time experimenting with prompt engineering, figuring out how to evaluate large language models, and helping design multi-agent systems that work together to solve real problems. You’ll also work alongside data scientists and ML engineers on deep learning projects like time series forecasting, building out our feature store, and running model experiments. The goal is to give you hands-on experience that feels both practical and forward-looking, so you leave with a stronger skill set and a clear sense of how AI gets applied in the real world.\n\nAt Global Partners, business starts with people. Since 1933, we’ve believed in taking care of our customers, our guests, our communities, and each other—and that belief continues to guide us.\n\nThe Global Spirit is the cornerstone of our commitment to success.
