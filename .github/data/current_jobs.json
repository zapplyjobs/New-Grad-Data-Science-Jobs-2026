When you apply, a Cisco representative may contact you directly if a relevant position opens.\n\nApplications are accepted until further notice.\n\nMeet the Team\n\nJoin our innovative engineering team focused on building next-generation AI/ML solutions. You’ll collaborate with skilled colleagues across platform, security, release engineering, and support teams to deliver high-impact products and ensure their flawless operation.\n\nYour Impact\n\nDive into the development and implementation of innovative generative AI applications using the latest large language models—think GPT-4, Claude, Llama, and beyond! Take on the challenge of optimizing neural networks for natural language processing and machine perception, drawing on a toolkit that includes convolutional and transformer-based models, student-teacher frameworks, distillation, and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Performance, scalability, and reliability are front and center as models are trained, fine-tuned, and put through their paces for real-world deployment.\n\nCollaboration is at the heart of this role—work alongside talented engineers and cross-functional teams to gather and prep data, design custom layers, and automate model deployment. Experimentation with new technologies and ongoing learning are always encouraged. Production-ready code, robust testing, and creative problem-solving all play a part in bringing innovative AI solutions to life. What an exciting place to grow and make an impact!\n\nMinimum Qualifications\n• Currently enrolled in an undergraduate degree program in a relevant field, such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Statistics, Mathematics, Software Engineering, or a related discipline.\n• Previous experience with model building, AI/LLM development, and programming in Python, SQL, or Go, including the use of common AI libraries, in an academic, project, or professional capacity.\n• Able to legally live and work in the country for which you’re applying, without visa support or sponsorship.\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• Experience with cloud-native solutions, Docker container orchestration, or modern rapid deployment platforms.\n• Knowledge of data pipeline design, tools, and maintenance.\n• Exposure to AI security, cybersecurity, or AI validation techniques (e.g., Guardrail).\n• Familiarity with MCP/Agent workflows or supply chain processes.\n• Experience contributing to AI-focused platforms or open tools (e.g., AI Defense Open Tools Portal, AI-SPM), data science toolkits such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, or Scikit-learn, and an understanding of Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts.\n\nProductIntern26\n\nWhy Cisco?\n\nAt Cisco, we’re revolutionizing how data and infrastructure connect and protect organizations in the AI era – and beyond. We’ve been innovating fearlessly for 40 years to create solutions that power how humans and technology work together across the physical and digital worlds. These solutions provide customers with unparalleled security, visibility, and insights across the entire digital footprint.\n\nFueled by the depth and breadth of our technology, we experiment and create meaningful solutions. Add to that our worldwide network of doers and experts, and you’ll see that the opportunities to grow and build are limitless. We work as a team, collaborating with empathy to make really big things happen on a global scale. Because our solutions are everywhere, our impact is everywhere.\n\nWe are Cisco, and our power starts with you.\n\nMessage to applicants applying to work in the U.S. and/or Canada:\n\nIndividual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location, market conditions, job-related skillset, experience, qualifications, education, certifications, and/or training.
