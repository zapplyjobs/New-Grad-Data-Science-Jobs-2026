We interact with our customers across more categories than any company in the world. The Customer Decision Science team which is a part of the Customer Insights & Strategy team in the Marketing org at Walmart analyzes every store trip, web and app visit, service interaction, search, click, purchase and survey response to help deliver the easiest shopping experience digitally and physically. We are a team of decision science practitioners who work together to uncover the why behind the customer behavior while measuring the outcomes from a customer and competitive lens. As a Senior Data Scientist in the team, you will have the unique opportunity to leverage the power of technology, big data and analytics to improve the lives of the 100M+ households that shop at Walmart every year. You will be responsible for driving Walmart’s High Value Habits initiatives by identifying the primary accelerators and decelerators of customer loyalty, translating these findings into actionable insights that directly inform high-level business strategy. What We’re Looking For\n• Well balanced skills – People have trouble pinning you down. Both business and technical/data teams claim you as their own. You are equal parts technical and functional. You are equally comfortable and effective in persuading both technical and business audiences.\n• Data science & analytics expertise – You excel at translating ambiguous business questions into concrete, actionable analysis plans and then executing them with precision. You are a pro at designing and building new and impactful customer-centric KPIs and metrics to measure customer and competitive dynamics. You are equally strong at getting into the weeds and making sure that the data needed to support these metrics is consistent and available. You are very comfortable rolling up your sleeves when needed to write complex SQL queries, building User Defined Functions (UDFs) to scale logic, and strive to balance speed with effective code design. You have mastery over the fundamentals of machine learning techniques (such as regression, clustering algorithms and/or causal inference) along with cohort analyses.\n• High Agency – You are able to use your expert understanding of data structures in order to scope and define data needs to execute projects. You are a relentless unblocker; when faced with technical debt or data gaps, you take the initiative to find a path forward without needing permission.\n• Project ownership – You are able to independently execute and oversee end-to-end projects with a high degree of ambiguity. You have strong organizational skills that enable you to manage multiple priorities, set expectations and collaborate across stakeholders, managers and peers.\n• Business acumen – You are able to translate insights into relevant business recommendations, anticipate the needs of business stakeholders and connect the dots across various teams, research and insights in order to build convincing and synthesized business recommendations.\n• Great communicator – You’re capable of telling the story behind the data to an executive audience and you are a pro at building slide decks that can simplify any complex story. You can customize your communication style based on stakeholders. You can easily translate a business question to an analysis technique and provide specs to engineering teams or analysts.\n• Data visualization – You are a pro at leveraging visualization to build compelling stories based on context to integrate multiple pieces of information into cohesive insights.\n• People leadership – You can influence decision making across peers and managers by supporting your point of view with data-driven insights.\nResponsibilities\n• Lead and execute advanced analytics for Walmart’s High Valua Habits initiatives, focusing on deepening customer loyalty and retention through data-driven strategic planning.\n• Proactively identify opportunities for business growth by mining customer data and translating these findings into a prioritized research and analytics roadmap.\n• Design, build, and deploy sophisticated quantitative frameworks (causal inference, propensity models, cohort analyses) that move beyond correlation to establish cause-and-effect in customer behavior.\n• Lead project teams that include Data Engineering, Product, Marketing, Strategy and Finance to ensure data-driven insights are integrated into the product roadmap and financial forecasts.\n• Implementing and scaling best practices. This includes writing/reviewing User Defined Functions (UDFs) to standardize complex business logic and advocating for reproducible research practices in R.\n• Executive Influence: Act as a subject matter expert in leadership forums, using data to challenge assumptions and drive a customer-centric culture.\nQualifications Minimum Qualifications\n• BA/BS in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Economics, or related field with 3-5+ years of experience in Data Science/Analytics; OR a Master’s degree with 2-3+ years of experience; OR a PhD with 2+ years of experience.\n• Mastery of SQL (BigQuery/Hive preferred). Expert experience building scalable, reusable data assets including the design and deployment of User Defined Functions (UDFs) to handle high-cardinality data and complex business transformations.\n• Expert proficiency in R or Python for statistical modeling, simulation, and data visualization (e.g., Tidyverse, ggplot2, Shiny for R; pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels for Python). Proven ability to write production-grade, reproducible code.\n• Deep proficiency in cohort analyses, clickstream data, and customer metrics. Proven track record of leveraging high-volume web/app event data to drive customer growth and inform product or marketing strategy.\n• Extensive experience in experimental design and observational causal methodologies (e.g., Propensity Score Matching, Difference-in-Differences, Synthetic Control).\n• Demonstrated ability to manage multiple high-impact projects simultaneously with high agency and minimal oversight.\nPreferred Qualifications\n• Experience developing internal R packages/UDFs to standardize team workflow\n• Deep experience in cloud-based big data environments (GCP/BigQuery or Snowflake), with a focus on optimizing query performance and cost.\n• Experience leading code reviews and mentoring junior team members on statistical best practices and efficient coding standards.\n• Prior experience in Retail, E-commerce, or analyzing complex omni-channel customer journeys.\nWhy You’ll Love Working Here We value high-ownership mentalities and intellectual curiosity.
