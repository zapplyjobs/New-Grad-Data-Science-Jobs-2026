    "job_description": "About Bridgewater \n\nBridgewater Associates is a premier asset management firm, focused on delivering unique insight and partnership for the most sophisticated global institutional investors. \n\nOur investment process is driven by a tireless pursuit to understand how the world's markets and economies work — using cutting-edge technology to validate and execute on timeless and universal investment principles. \n\nFounded in 1975, we are a community of independent thinkers who share a commitment to excellence. By fostering a culture of openness, transparency, and inclusion, we strive to unlock the most complex questions in investment strategy, management, and corporate culture. \n\nExplore more information about Bridgewater on our website here. \n\nOur Culture \n\nOur culture is anchored in excellence, meaning constant improvement, and it is deeply tied to our mission. Because markets are objective, competitive, and getting smarter everyday, we need to keep rapidly improving to have any chance of beating them. Truth is our most essential tool for engaging with the markets and constantly improving because once you know what's true about your problems and opportunities, you can determine how to get better. Valuing truth means being transparent about your decision-making and mistakes, giving and receiving feedback with humility, and fighting for the best answers over hierarchy, ego, or self-interest. Operating this way is hard – it's only possible because we build meaning in our work and relationships. This meaning comes from the audacity of the mission, and the joy of working alongside people who make you a better version of yourself. The culture, like Bridgewater itself, is always evolving. In 1997 our founder Ray Dalio wrote down his lessons, starting with a Philosophy Statement which remains our foundation. This later evolved into a set of 300+ Principles. In 2022, when Ray transitioned the company, we re-underwrote several of those principles and evolved others, with a specific focus on Meritocracy. Today the culture sits, alongside our people, as our most important edge. When we get it right, it's the engine that powers everything else.\n\nAbout the Team\n\nThis role sits in our Asia Strategies department. The goal of Asia Strategies is to continue our growth down the journey of being the premier investment management firm in the region. This entails developing great investment strategies reflecting our expertise, generating alpha in the markets, researching and publishing our understanding of the macroeconomic environment, and designing solutions to help our clients invest across the region.\n\nAbout Your Role\n\nWe are seeking a Quantitative Researcher to join a PM-led pod focused on systematic macro and long/short equity strategies in APAC. You will work alongside the PM in a tight knit and fast paced environment with consistent exposure to a Bridgewater CIO.

Generate ideas to improve existing signals. Contribute ideas for discretionary trades and overlays to the portfolio.\n• Discovery – Identify and assess new datasets to identify their merit in our investment process. Follow and look to implement the latest developments in academic research. Experiment with new technologies to improve both our investment process and research and development environment.\n• Collaboration – Work across our data engineers, developers, and researchers to evolve our research platform and data ecosystem. Engage with the broader Asia strategies team to share observations and generate ideas.\n\nInterested in learning more about working at Bridgewater?

We seek a diverse group of innovative thinkers and push them to engage in rigorous and thoughtful inquiry. We develop people through an honest examination of their abilities and performance, enabling personal growth and professional development. We strive to provide you opportunities that will challenge you and unlock your potential.\n\nCompensation\n• The expected annual base salary for this position is $250,000-$300,000.
