    "job_description": "The Mission\n\nWhile most of the industry is building wrappers around closed-source APIs, we are building Sovereign AI. We design, deploy, and scale sophisticated agentic systems on our own private infrastructure. We are looking for a Senior AI Engineer who moves past \"prompt engineering\" to architect complex, stateful workflows where data security and hardware efficiency are the primary constraints. If you believe the future of AI belongs to those who own the weights and the silicon, you belong here.\n\nThe Role\n\nAs a Senior AI Engineer, you will own the end-to-end lifecycle of our internal AI ecosystem—from optimizing local inference engines to orchestrating multi-agent swarms. You will build systems that don't just \"chat,\" but reason, execute tools, and maintain state over long-running business processes. This is a role for a \"full-stack\" AI engineer: someone who understands both the mathematical foundations of LLMs and the systems engineering required to run them at scale on-premise.\n\nCore Responsibilities\n• Agentic Orchestration: Architect multi-agent systems using LangGraph or PydanticAI, implementing advanced patterns like Plan-and-Execute, Self-Reflection, and Multi-Agent Handoffs.\n• Production RAG: Build high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines utilizing hybrid search, cross-encoders, and re-ranking within our private vector stores.\n• On-Premise Optimization: Manage the full inference stack. You will be responsible for optimizing model performance (latency vs. throughput) on local GPU clusters using vLLM, TGI, or TensorRT-LLM.\n• Stateful Architecture: Design resilient workflows that handle long-running tasks, error recovery, and complex \"human-in-the-loop\" interactions.\n• Evaluation & Benchmarking: Develop rigorous, automated \"LLM-as-a-judge\" frameworks to evaluate agentic performance, ensuring reliability and grounding.\n\nTechnical Requirements\n• Agentic Frameworks: Expert-level mastery of LangGraph (state machines/persistence) or PydanticAI (type-safe logic/structured outputs).\n• Python Mastery: Deep experience in asynchronous Python and building scalable, production-grade backend services (FastAPI, Pydantic).\n• Infrastructure & Deployment: Proven experience deploying open-weights models (Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek) on bare-metal or private Kubernetes environments.\n• The \"Inner Workings\": A strong grasp of LLM fundamentals, including attention mechanisms, KV caching, and the impact of tokenization on performance/cost.\n\nNice to Have (The Extra Mile)\n\nThis role is specifically for engineers who enjoy the challenge of hardware constraints and model ownership:\n• Model Training & Refinement: Experience with the full training lifecycle:\n• Pretraining: Knowledge of data curation, pruning, and continued pretraining on domain-specific datasets.\n• Post-training: Hands-on experience with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and alignment techniques like DPO, ORPO, or RLHF.\n• Model Compression & Efficiency: Deep knowledge of quantization (GGUF, AWQ, EXL2), model distillation, and graph optimization to squeeze maximum performance out of local hardware.\n• VRAM Management: Ability to perform \"VRAM math\"—calculating memory requirements for various model sizes (e.g., 70B vs 8B) relative to context window length, batch sizes, and KV cache pressure.\n• Data Sovereignty: A passion for building private systems where data privacy and infrastructure control are paramount.\n\nJob Type: Full-time\n\nPay: $5,000.00 - $7,000.00 per month\n\nBenefits:\n• Paid time off\n\nWork Location: In person",

    "job_description": "American Express invites you to share your resume so you can be considered for future Agentic AI opportunities in the Enterprise Technology Services organization.\n\nAt American Express, our culture is built on a 175-year history of innovation, shared values and Leadership Behaviors, and an unwavering commitment to back our customers, communities, and colleagues. As part of Team Amex, you'll experience this powerful backing with comprehensive support for your holistic well-being and many opportunities to learn new skills, develop as a leader, and grow your career.\n\nHere, your voice and ideas matter, your work makes an impact, and together, you will help us define the future of American Express.\n\nAI is reshaping the future of commerce and redefining the experiences our commercial customers and card members expect. Within Amex Technology, we are building platforms, products, and governance that enable agentic AI systems to operate responsibly and at scale across the enterprise.\n\nOur focus is on agentic AI development: designing intelligent, adaptive systems that can plan, reason, and act across complex workflows with appropriate levels of autonomy. These systems power autonomous workflows, decision support, and customer-facing experiences—while meeting the high standards for security, explainability, reliability, and compliance required in financial services.\n\nWe partner closely with product, design, and business teams to deliver agentic capabilities that reduce operational friction, improve decision-making, and transform how customers interact, transact, and grow.\n\nThe Role\n\nAs a Staff Software Engineer – Agentic AI, you will operate as a senior individual contributor within Amex Technology, helping define how agentic AI systems are designed, built, and operated across the company.\nYou will work at the intersection of agentic system architecture and hands-on execution: designing core frameworks, writing production code, reviewing critical designs, and guiding teams through complex technical decisions. This role does not include people management; your impact comes from technical leadership, sound judgment, and the ability to turn ambiguity into reliable, scalable agentic systems.\n\nYou will work closely with Product and UX partners to shape a shared vision for agentic AI experiences. While product teams own prioritization, Staff engineers are expected to actively influence what gets built and how agentic systems come together across teams.\n\nWe are primarily looking for senior individual contributors; however, as the team grows, you will take on increasing responsibility for technical leadership and people development within the agentic AI space. Mentoring, developing and managing direct reports may be in scope for some of our opportunities.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n• Drive technical direction for agentic AI initiatives, influencing architecture patterns, autonomy boundaries, and system design.\n• Design, build, and operate production-grade agentic AI systems used across multiple products.\n• Own and evolve shared agentic AI capabilities, including:\n• Agent frameworks and orchestration layers\n• Planning, tool use, and memory strategies\n• Retrieval and grounding (RAG) pipelines\n• LLM infrastructure, inference, and model gateways\n• Evaluation, observability, and safety tooling for autonomous systems\n• Lead technical design reviews and help teams navigate tradeoffs involving autonomy, safety, reliability, scalability, and cost.\n• Partner across teams to deliver complex, cross-cutting agentic AI initiatives from concept to production.\n• Evaluate emerging models, techniques, and agentic patterns and translate them into practical, enterprise-ready improvements.\n• Mentor senior engineers and raise the technical bar for agentic AI development through example and influence.\n\nTechnical Environment\n\nWe don’t hire to a narrow checklist, but candidates should be comfortable operating in a modern, enterprise-scale engineering environment with a strong emphasis on agentic AI.\n\nCore engineering stack\n• Languages: Python, Go, TypeScript\n• APIs and RPC: REST, gRPC (and in some areas tRPC)\n• Cloud and infrastructure: AWS and/or GCP, Kubernetes\n• Distributed systems: event-driven architectures, including Kafka\n\nAgentic AI and ML\n• Integration of commercial and open-source LLMs into agentic workflows\n• Agent and orchestration frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, or CrewAI, with strong judgment about when to use frameworks versus building lighter-weight primitives\n• Model-level work using PyTorch and the Hugging Face ecosystem (embeddings, fine-tuning, inference tooling), with some exposure to TensorFlow\n• Strong schema, validation, and state management practices using tools such as Pydantic (Python) and Zod (TypeScript)\n\nAcross all systems, we emphasize evaluation, observability, safety, and reliability, reflecting the responsibility of deploying autonomous AI in a regulated, customer-facing environment.\n\nWhat We’re Looking For\n• 10+ years of software engineering experience, including deep, hands-on experience delivering agentic AI or LLM-powered systems to production.\n• Proven ownership of complex, cross-cutting agentic systems spanning multiple teams or products.\n• Strong engineering fundamentals across backend systems, APIs, data pipelines, and cloud infrastructure.\n• Deep experience across the agentic AI stack, including planning, tool use, memory, and evaluation.\n• Fluency with AI-assisted and agentic development workflows.\n• Comfort operating in ambiguous problem spaces and translating them into shipped, reliable autonomous systems.\n• Ability to influence technical direction and align teams without formal authority.\n• Experience in workflow engines, async processing, queues, and streaming systems.\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• Experience building agentic systems in fintech or other regulated industries.\n• Experience as a founding engineer or early technical leader in AI-driven products.\n• Demonstrated success delivering technically complex autonomous systems that customers actively rely on.\n• Meaningful contributions to open-source AI or agentic frameworks.\n• Familiarity with fine-tuning, model optimization and inference pipelines is a plus.\n\nWe back you with benefits that support your holistic well-being so you can be and deliver your best. This means caring for you and your loved ones' physical, financial, and mental health, as well as providing the flexibility you need to thrive personally and professionally:\n• Competitive base salaries\n• Bonus incentives\n• 6% Company Match on retirement savings plan\n• Free financial coaching and financial well-being support\n• Comprehensive medical, dental, vision, life insurance, and disability benefits\n• Flexible working model with hybrid, onsite or virtual arrangements depending on role and business need\n• 20+ weeks paid parental leave for all parents, regardless of gender, offered for pregnancy, adoption or surrogacy\n• Free access to global on-site wellness centers staffed with nurses and doctors (depending on location)\n• Free and confidential counseling support through our Healthy Minds program\n• Career development and training opportunities\n\nFor a full list of Team Amex benefits, visit our Colleague Benefits Site.\n\nAmerican Express is an equal opportunity employer and makes employment decisions without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran status, disability status, age, or any other status protected by law.
