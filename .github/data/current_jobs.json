We do offer relocation assistance. Please see our careers page or inquire with your recruiter about the terms and conditions.\n\nSalary and other Compensation:\n\nThe hourly wage range for this position: $62.00 - $125.00\n\nThe salary range for this position is subject not only to the hire's skills, education, expertise, and years of experience, but also to features of the final position offered to the hire: including, but not limited to the location of the position, clearance required for the position, and the contract associated with the position. See our Perks & Benefits page for a general description of benefits and other potential compensation benefits: https://www.ciphertechsolutions.com/careers/perks-benefits/\n\nAbout Us:\n\nAt Cipher Tech Solutions, Inc. (Cipher Tech), we take great pride in supporting some of the most mission critical work in the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community. The majority of our company is comprised of extremely talented software developers who write production tools which directly support one of two missions: digital forensics and malware reverse engineering.\n\nDigital forensics is the practice of extracting and processing evidence from computers, phones, tablets, cameras, flash-drives, and just about any other form of digital media. The results of our work are then used to support federal and military law enforcement, counterintelligence, and counter terrorist activities.\n\nMalware reverse engineering is the practice of analyzing malicious code. The goal of a reverse engineer is to understand how the malicious code works and determine facts such as:\n• How did it infect the victim's computer *What kind of information it is seeking to steal *How is it communicating with the author (actor) *Who that actor might be.\n\nVaccination Notice:\n\nPlease be aware that you are applying for a position to work as a federal contractor. As such, Cipher Tech will require, and your employment will be subject to, such vaccinations as are required by federal, state, and local law requirements.\n\nImportant Security Clearance Information:\n\nBe aware that you are applying for a job that requires you currently hold a U.S. Government Security Clearance at time of application.\n\nThe U.S. government will not issue security clearances to recent users of illegal drugs. On your application to us, you must acknowledge that you have not engaged in any illegal drug use within the past twelve months (illegal drug use includes, but is not limited to, the use of illegal substances, the misuse of prescriptions, the misuse of over-the-counter substances, and the use of medical or recreational marijuana that may be deemed legal at the state level but is still considered illegal by the federal government). NOTE: CIPHER TECH WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANY QUALIFIED APPLICANTS WITH A DISABILITY, INCLUDING ILLEGAL DRUG USERS WHO HAVE RECENTLY SOUGHT PROFESSIONAL TREATMENT FOR A DRUG PROBLEM.\n\n-\n\nCipher Tech is an Equal Opportunity Employer. All hiring and employment decisions are made on the basis of business requirements, performance, and merit with no regard to race, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, national origin, or other protected status.\n\nAll qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.",

We are seeking experienced software engineers to build analytical frameworks and tools that empower internal users to construct quantitative analysis pipelines and develop metrics. These metrics will support and accelerate feature design, prioritization, and development, as well as evaluate the impact of recently released features. Our analytics framework equally supports road event monitoring, data mining and training, and simulation metrics.\n\nAbout the Organization: The Simulation, Evaluation, and Data organization is dedicated to advancing the development of autonomous vehicles through cutting-edge simulation technologies. The Metrics Frameworks team within this organization focuses on creating, maintaining, and evolving the analytics framework that supports GM's goal of safe, high-performing, and scalable driverless technology. The team delivers robust and scalable tools that facilitate data-driven decision-making throughout the AV feature development lifecycle. We collaborate closely with Simulation Evaluation, Embodied AI, and System and Test Engineering teams to enhance productivity across the organization by developing automation tools and shared libraries for all engineering teams. We are accountable for the performance, reliability, and scalability OKRs of the analytics framework. This includes, but is not limited to, developing customized analytics workflows, improving operational telemetry and dashboards to track relevant KPIs for prioritization, and identifying, designing, and implementing solutions to achieve key results.\n\nWhat You’ll Do:\n• Create tooling that can receive signals from various sources (Simulation, Road, etc) and allow users to easily build quantitative analysis pipelines to extract usable insights.\n• Accelerate team’s effectiveness and efficiency by designing and implementing scalable automation tools for test creation, data collection and analysis, debugging, and performance monitoring.\n• Design and implement extensible and well-tested shared libraries that will be used by many engineers across the organization.\n• Collaborate with other frameworks and data infra teams to build and deploy tools to improve productivity.\n• Work closely with autonomous vehicle engineering to enable rapid development and model feedback.\n• Maintain a high technical standard for code quality on the team, through architectural design and code reviews.\n\nYour Skills & Abilities:\n• Experience developing scalable software solutions that will be used by many developers\n• Experience writing Python and C++ in a production environment (unit testing, code review, algorithm performance and tradeoffs, etc.)\n• Experience developing automation scripts (Python and Bash scripts)\n• BS in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or Aerospace Engineering\n• 5+ years of industry experience\n• Strong organizational and communication skills\n\nWhat Will Give You A Competitive Edge:\n• Experience with SQL and related tools/tech (Big Query, DuckDB, etc)\n• Experience with time-series data analysis and online performance monitoring tools\n• Experience building high performance framework / infrastructure and performance optimization in C++/Python\n• Familiarity with ROS, Pandas, Python bindings for C++, and plotting/visualization libraries\n• Familiarity with Data orchestration and transformation tools like AirTable, AirFlow, DBT, etc\n\nCompensation : The salary range for this role is ($129,000 and $198,400). The actual base salary a successful candidate will be offered within this range will vary based on factors relevant to the position.\n\nHybrid: This role is categorized as hybrid.

The Volkswagen Group with its headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany is one of the world’s leading automobile manufacturers and the largest carmaker in Europe. The Group comprises twelve brands from seven European countries: Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, SEAT, ŠKODA, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche, Ducati, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles, Scania and MAN.\n\nBrief Role Description\n\nAt the Innovation & Engineering Center California (IECC), we represent the Volkswagen Group in applied research and development. Located in the heart of Silicon Valley, we create bold new ideas for the Volkswagen, Audi, Bentley, Lamborghini, Bugatti and Porsche brands. We’re a team of engineers, designers, scientists, and psychologists looking to develop innovations for future generations of cars, and to transfer technologies from many industries and research institutions into the automotive domain. Our mission is to drive change which means we are not only impacting one of the world’s largest car makers, but also the lives of millions of people. Are you ready to join us?\n\nRole Summary\n\nThis role will be tasked with applying machine learning/deep learning to the automotive industry. Applications could include autonomous driving, manufacturing, design etc. This is more than a purely academic role – you will likely need to integrate the modules you build into real cars and also think about questions around testability and proving safety.
