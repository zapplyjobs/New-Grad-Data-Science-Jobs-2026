As the Engineering Manager for a products squad, you will manage 2+ engineers with varied backgrounds and focuses:\n• Machine learning engineers (MLEs) build models and features\n• Data engineers fulfill the availability and latency requirements provided by MLEs\n• Some software engineers partner with MLEs to operationalize and expose models and features\n• Other software engineers focus on our ML platform and tooling, including A/B testing\n\nKey challenges the team will tackle in next couple of quarters:\n• Content Summaries: Support testing and adoption of various types of content summaries from multiple domains, which can be leveraged in consumer experiences along with embedding generation and classification\n• Two-Tower Experimentation: Explore options for incorporating additional user context in our personalized recommendations model such as geolocation, time of day and time of year\n• All Access Search: Partner with teams across CNN to incorporate streaming content and add support for OTT\n• Bandit Foundation: Enhance data access and begin experimenting with bandits for online ranking of recommendations\n• Optimize Site Performance: Dynamically deliver personalized content alongside cached assets, improving load times and enhancing user experience with features like page-level deduplication\n\nYour Role Accountabilities...\n• Support, coach, mentor, and provide valuable feedback to the individuals you manage to help them excel\n• Work with cross-functional partners and stakeholders on activities such as planning, technical strategy, quality and delivery\n• Partner with engineers within the team and across the organization to build and integrate machine learning features into our site, apps, and editorial tools\n• Lead other engineers on the team by example, code reviews, and coaching, ensuring that code is readable, maintainable, scalable, observable, and resilient\n• Champion improvements to developer experience, integrations, and testing processes\n• Leverage vended and open-source cloud technologies to reduce maintenance costs and improve efficiencies, ensuring our products remain profitable\n• Collaborate with other engineers to develop and enhance core capabilities, infrastructure, and architecture\n\nHere is the approach we value:\n• Author, review, and optimize production-quality code that adheres to industry standards and best practices (IaC, CICD, etc.)\n• Demonstrate a passion for software engineering, with a strong sense of responsibility for the code you and your team write\n• Take ownership of issues and be a strong advocate for your team and the products\n• Embrace failure as a learning opportunity—use research and experimentation to ultimately choose the best solutions that meet company goals\n• Follow a progressive development methodology, moving from proof-of-concept to prototype to production release\n• Enhance the effectiveness of your squad, the team, and our partners by sharing your knowledge, communicating about complex technologies and problems in simple terms, and driving technical decisions\n• Collaborate across functions, squads, teams, and organizations to best serve our users\n\nQualifications & Experience...\n• 8+ years progressively complex experience designing, building, and shipping products\n• 5+ years backend engineering experience with data-heavy applications\n• 3+ years of experience with IaC, deployment pipelines, and relational databases\n• 5+ years of experience managing engineering teams\n• Experience partnering with and / or leading ICs responsible for machine learning model development (data scientists, MLEs, etc.)\n• Familiarity with ML specific pipelines and tooling\n• Familiarity with experimentation frameworks and A/B testing methodologies\n• Deep understanding of common software data structures and algorithms, with extensive experience in modern development technologies and practices\n• A proven track record of building web scale products that are highly available and performant\n• Passion for growing engineers through mentorship, talent acquisition, and professional development\n• A collaborative mindset, understanding that great results come from teamwork and a positive culture\n• Proven success leading complex projects within an engineering team: knowing when to handle issues independently, when to rally the right people for alignment, and when to escalate\n• Excellent communication, presentation, and documentation skills\n\nThe Nice to Haves...\n• Practical experience with recommendations, search and/or personalization\n• Practical experience building cost-effective ML solutions at scale\n• Experience with RAG pipelines, feature stores, or embedding infrastructure\n\nAdditional Information\n\nOn December 5, Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Netflix will acquire Warner Bros., including its film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO. The transaction is expected to close after the separation of Warner Bros. Discovery's Global Networks division, Discovery Global, into a new publicly-traded company, which is expected to be completed in Q3 2026. For more details, including leadership appointments and information on individual brands, please visit our newsroom here.\n\nAlthough you will be hired by Warner Bros. Discovery, upon the planned spin-off of Discovery Global in 2026, your employment likely will transition to Discovery Global. During this period of transformation, you’ll have an exciting opportunity to lay the foundation at one of the world’s premier entertainment brands.\n\nHow We Get Things Done…\n\nThis last bit is probably the most important! Here at WBD, our guiding principles are the core values by which we operate and are central to how we get things done. You can find them at www.wbd.com/guiding-principles/ along with some insights from the team on what they mean and how they show up in their day to day.
