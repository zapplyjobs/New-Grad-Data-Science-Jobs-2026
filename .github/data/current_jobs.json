In addition, the Department of 110 clinical residents and fellows are distributed across the Divisions. The missions of research, education, and patient care are intertwined, and are integral to the goals of the department. The Department has undergone significant growth in recent years with a consolidated budget of approximately $138 million including sponsored projects expenditures of approximately $65 million and clinical revenue of over $73 million. This expansion of the Department's research and clinical portfolio is expected to continue in the next few years.The Department's 17 divisions include Academic General Pediatrics, Child Development& Community Health; Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology; Cardiology; Environmental Science & Health; Emergency Medicine; Endocrinology; Gastroenterology; Genetics; Genome Information Sciences; Hematology/Oncology; Hospital Medicine; Infectious Diseases; Neonatology; Nephrology; Pharmacology & Drug Discovery; Rehabilitation Medicine; and Respiratory Medicine.In 2001, physicians and leadership of the University of California, San Diego, (UCSD), Rady Children's, and Children's Specialists of San Diego (CSSD) unified pediatric patient care, research, education, and community service programs, creating a university-affiliated children's health system to serve the region. Over the past two decades, an extensive list of joint programs has developed, with many physicians and researchers playing a role at both institutions. This affiliation has consolidated the clinical, teaching, research, and public service programs of the UCSD School of Medicine's Department of Pediatrics with San Diego's only health care system dedicated to the health and well-being of children. In 2009, this partnership was furthered by the creation of the Rady Children's Specialist of San Diego, a Medical Foundation, and is now recognized as having global leaders in research, technology, translational medicine, education, and clinical experience.The Division of Environmental Science & Health is involved in four major areas: 1) providing clinical services to patients with birth defects and developmental disabilities, 2) providing public health services in counseling patients, providers, and education to the public about prenatal exposures and exposures during breastfeeding and their impact on child development and health, 3) a teaching program that includes undergraduate students, graduate students in epidemiology, medical students, and post-doctoral students, pediatrics, epidemiology, health behavior, global health, pharmacy, and other specialties; and, 4) conducting clinical research.The Center for Better Beginnings within the Division of Environmental Science & Health in the Department of Pediatrics at UCSD conducts research studies to better understand the causes, prevention, and treatment of birth defects and developmental disabilities.
