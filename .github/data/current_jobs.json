We're powered by people, driven by technology, and dedicated to our clients and employees. If you're looking for a collaborative and diverse culture with a great work/life balance, look no further.\n\nLocation:Remote - USA\n\nAs a Principal Machine Learning Engineer (individual contributor) at Revecore, you will:\n\nUse your expertise in machine learning, exploratory data analysis, and software engineering to enhance the productivity and efficiency of our underpayment business. You will work on projects with purpose, such as prioritizing claims based on expected recovery dollars and improving our claim-remit matching process.\n\nThis is a modeling team that owns the model deployment process. You won't be creating dashboards or pivot tables. You won't just build POCs. Our team increases revenue and decreases costs: you will deploy your work and see the results as we increase our client hospitals' revenue.\n\nThe Role:\n• Own end-to-end development, training, deployment, evaluation, and improvement of machine learning systems to rank claim opportunities.\n• Analyze and explore data to identify actionable opportunities from internal and 3rd party data.\n• Research, implement, and launch new model architectures that drive business impact.\n• Partner and collaborate with cross-functional teams of software engineers, data engineers, subject matter experts, product managers, and analysts to design and build practical solutions.\n• Implement cloud MLOps and AIOps best practices to streamline the development, deployment, and maintenance of machine learning models.\n• Continuously measure the impact of the AI-enabled workflows on key business metrics and use these measurements to improve the machine learning models and workflows.\n• Learn from and teach your teammates. You will be the team's expert in your specialization, and you will learn from experts in theirs.\n• Own a workstream. You'll be the technical lead for the workstream, partnering with others to deliver. This includes guiding the work of and mentoring a less-senior teammate. You'll also work on other projects, but this workstream will be one of your key successes.\n• Have a voice in Revecore's strategy in your areas of expertise while still being primarily a hands-on-keyboard individual contributor.\n\nYou'll be successful if you have:\n• An urge to question assumptions, and to get it right (or at least good enough) even if your first idea is wrong.\n• A commitment to collaborate, rather than go off in a corner only to appear when you need to submit a pull request.\n• A bachelor's degree in any data-centric field. Scientific thinking is a must.\n• Experience working in a similar role, with a focus on machine learning or data science.\n• Experience developing and deploying machine learning models in a production environment.\n• Strong experience with Python, including scikit-learn. TensorFlow or PyTorch is a plus.\n• Ability to wrangle data, perform exploratory data analysis, and draw insights from visualizations.\n\nIt would also be great if you have:\n• Intuition about data developed by doing statistics and/or research. Bonus points if you know the difference between MAR and MCAR, or can draw causal inferences from historical data.\n• Applied experience with contemporary natural language processing (NLP) techniques and tools (e.g., entity extraction, transformers, Hugging Face).\n• Experience with Spark.\n• Experience with operating ML pipelines in a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).\n• A master's degree, Ph.D., or other experience demonstrating scientific thinking.\n\nAs part of our team, you'll be rewarded with:\n• Comprehensive medical, dental, vision, and life insurance benefits from the start of your employment.\n• 12 paid holidays and flexible paid time off.\n• 401(k) contributions.\n• Employee Resource Groups that build community.\n• Career growth opportunities.\n• An excellent work/life balance.\n\nWork at Home Requirements:\n• A quiet, distraction-free environment to work from in your home.\n• A secure home internet connection with speeds >20 Mbps for downloads and >10 Mbps for uploads is required.\n• The workspace area accommodates all workstation equipment and related materials and provides adequate surface area to be productive.\n\nRevecore is an equal opportunity employer that does not discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability status, veteran status, genetic information, or any other legally protected status.\n\nWe believe that a diverse workforce fosters innovation and creativity, enriches our culture, and enables us to better serve the needs of our clients and communities.

    "job_description": "About the Role\n\nThe NOVA AI team builds the platform and AI that powers world‑class support across mobile, web, and voice at global scale. We are now hiring a Senior ML Engineer to build and scale an autonomous support agent that resolves customer issues end‑to‑end. You’ll push the state of the art in GenAI for customer service—LLM orchestration, evaluation, safety guardrails, multilingual support—while holding a very high bar for reliability and cost efficiency. We are still at an early stage and value candidates with bias for action who get creative with GenAI tools to accelerate execution and experimentation.\n\nWhat the Candidate Will Need / Bonus Points\n\n---- What the Candidate Will Do ----\n• Work on agent architecture: agentic planning and execution loops, long-term memory, persona/voice, knowledge routing, and policy enforcement for compliant, on‑brand conversations.\n• Ship production systems that handle millions of conversations with rigorous SLOs, fallbacks, and canaries; design graceful degradation (e.g., human handoff) and safety guardrails (prompt‑injection, jailbreak, PII redaction).\n• Advance retrieval & reasoning: Build next-generation retrieval and reasoning pipelines, where the agent can search across different knowledge sources, apply policy-driven tools, and call structured workflows and ensure that responses are consistently grounded.\n• Establish evals that matter: offline rubrics, simulated scenarios, safety tests, cost/latency tradeoff suites, and LLM‑as‑judge (with calibrated human review) wired into CI/CD and experiment platforms.\n• Drive automation at scale: partner with Product/Design/Operations on coverage, policy alignment, localization, and rollout strategy to better customer experience and reduce cost per contact.\n\n---- Basic Qualifications ----\n• Background in LLM‑driven systems (inference optimization, prompt/program design, fine‑tuning, distillation/LoRA, safety/guardrails, evals).\n• Strong software engineering in Python\n• Bachelor's degree (or above) in Computer Science or related field\n\n---- Preferred Qualifications ----\n• Agentic architectures in production (planner/executor, memory, multi‑step reasoning) and RAG over complex, policy‑heavy knowledge bases.\n• Experience building support automation for large consumer platforms (routing, policy codification, internal tooling, co‑pilot/auto‑resolve).\n• Multilingual NLU/NLG (code‑switching, low‑resource languages), hallucination mitigation, safety red‑teaming, and privacy‑by‑design.\n• Practical expertise balancing speed and reliability at scale: experiment frameworks, feature flags, canary/guarded rollouts, and clear kill‑switches.\n\nFor Sunnyvale, CA-based roles: The base salary range for this role is USD$171,000 per year - USD$190,000 per year.\n\nYou will be eligible to participate in Uber's bonus program, and may be offered an equity award & other types of comp. All full-time employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan. You will also be eligible for various benefits. More details can be found at the following link https://jobs.uber.com/en/benefits.\n\nUber's mission is to reimagine the way the world moves for the better. Here, bold ideas create real-world impact, challenges drive growth, and speed fuels progress. What moves us, moves the world - let's move it forward, together.\n\nUber is proud to be an Equal Opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, color, religion, national origin, disability, protected Veteran status, age, or any other characteristic protected by law. We also consider qualified applicants regardless of criminal histories, consistent with legal requirements. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation, please let us know by completing this form.\n\nOffices continue to be central to collaboration and Uber's cultural identity.
