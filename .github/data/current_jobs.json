Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.\n\nYour safety matters to us. To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you're ever unsure about a communication, don't click any links—visit anthropic.com/careers directly for confirmed position openings.\n\nHow We're Different\n\nWe believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We're an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.\n\nThe easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.\n\nCome work with us!\n\nAnthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.

protect some of the world’s most valuable data, Galois develops technology to guarantee the trustworthiness of systems where failure is unacceptable.\nWe are a community of researchers, engineers, and operations people dedicated to creating trustworthiness in critical systems in every functional area of the organization.\nOur unique organizational structure enables us to adapt to the needs of the innovative projects we deliver.\nWhat We Do: We believe trustworthy systems are built on a formal mathematical foundation.\nOur researchers apply formal analysis techniques to the design and verification of critical software systems, allowing us to model, analyze, and mathematically prove that a system behaves exactly as intended under all circumstances.\nWith clients including NASA, DARPA, AWS, and the DoW, we leverage our cutting-edge research to deliver high assurance solutions and tools that enhance security, reliability, and operational efficiency across sectors including aerospace & defense, healthcare, semiconductors, and fintech.\nResearch Engineers at Galois design and develop advanced technologies for safety- and security-critical systems, networks, and applications.\nEngineers work in small team settings and must successfully interact with clients, partners, and other employees in a highly cooperative, collaborative, and intellectually challenging environment.\nLife at Galois: People are the foundation of Galois’s success.\nAs an employee-owned company, we care not only about the technologies we develop, but also the path we take to create

theory research and implementation.\nResearchers in this role will use their expertise in Formal Methods and Programming Languages to conduct rigorous formal verification of software and systems, ensuring they meet the highest security standards.\nResponsibilities\nAs a Research Engineer, you will have the following responsibilities:\n• Requirements gathering: engaging the client in a series of discussions, where each iteration refines the needs of the client, and leads to the suggestion of means to meet those needs.\n• Architecture and design: constructing high-level architectural descriptions of software systems, and constructing deeper program designs by fleshing out architecture prototypes.\nArchitectures must be designed with assurance in mind, determining where and how formal methods are to be applied.\n• Implementation: extending design prototypes through to a finished product, with care taken to ensure robustness and ease of use.\n• Formal verification: use
