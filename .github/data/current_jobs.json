We are seeking experienced software engineers to build analytical frameworks and tools that empower internal users to construct quantitative analysis pipelines and develop metrics. These metrics will support and accelerate feature design, prioritization, and development, as well as evaluate the impact of recently released features. Our analytics framework equally supports road event monitoring, data mining and training, and simulation metrics.\n\nAbout the Organization: The Simulation, Evaluation, and Data organization is dedicated to advancing the development of autonomous vehicles through cutting-edge simulation technologies. The Metrics Frameworks team within this organization focuses on creating, maintaining, and evolving the analytics framework that supports GM's goal of safe, high-performing, and scalable driverless technology. The team delivers robust and scalable tools that facilitate data-driven decision-making throughout the AV feature development lifecycle. We collaborate closely with Simulation Evaluation, Embodied AI, and System and Test Engineering teams to enhance productivity across the organization by developing automation tools and shared libraries for all engineering teams. We are accountable for the performance, reliability, and scalability OKRs of the analytics framework. This includes, but is not limited to, developing customized analytics workflows, improving operational telemetry and dashboards to track relevant KPIs for prioritization, and identifying, designing, and implementing solutions to achieve key results.\n\nWhat You’ll Do:\n• Create tooling that can receive signals from various sources (Simulation, Road, etc) and allow users to easily build quantitative analysis pipelines to extract usable insights.\n• Accelerate team’s effectiveness and efficiency by designing and implementing scalable automation tools for test creation, data collection and analysis, debugging, and performance monitoring.\n• Design and implement extensible and well-tested shared libraries that will be used by many engineers across the organization.\n• Collaborate with other frameworks and data infra teams to build and deploy tools to improve productivity.\n• Work closely with autonomous vehicle engineering to enable rapid development and model feedback.\n• Maintain a high technical standard for code quality on the team, through architectural design and code reviews.\n\nYour Skills & Abilities:\n• Experience developing scalable software solutions that will be used by many developers\n• Experience writing Python and C++ in a production environment (unit testing, code review, algorithm performance and tradeoffs, etc.)\n• Experience developing automation scripts (Python and Bash scripts)\n• BS in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or Aerospace Engineering\n• 5+ years of industry experience\n• Strong organizational and communication skills\n\nWhat Will Give You A Competitive Edge:\n• Experience with SQL and related tools/tech (Big Query, DuckDB, etc)\n• Experience with time-series data analysis and online performance monitoring tools\n• Experience building high performance framework / infrastructure and performance optimization in C++/Python\n• Familiarity with ROS, Pandas, Python bindings for C++, and plotting/visualization libraries\n• Familiarity with Data orchestration and transformation tools like AirTable, AirFlow, DBT, etc\n\nCompensation : The salary range for this role is ($129,000 and $198,400). The actual base salary a successful candidate will be offered within this range will vary based on factors relevant to the position.\n\nHybrid: This role is categorized as hybrid. This means the successful candidate is expected to report to the Mountain View, San Francisco, Warren or Milford Technical Center three times per week, at minimum.",

We’re building out a high-velocity team of multi-disciplinary experts to turn real-world operations into high-quality data for our autonomous partners. This team will be focused on the hardest problem in AV today: unlocking real-world, long-tail driving data. Autonomy is now a data race–and Uber has an edge: We collect rare, real-world driving data at a scale and capital efficiency no one else can match (millions of Uber trips every hour across cities, conditions, and edge cases create the data autonomy has been missing). We will build platforms that harness scale and real-world complexity to reimagine how the world moves.\n\nYou will be an ML engineer in AV Labs conducting autonomous vehicle modeling and research, with an emphasis on developing foundational and applied techniques that shape the future of autonomous driving. The ideal candidate will formulate research problems, design and evaluate novel modeling approaches, and influence the direction of large-scale autonomous systems through strong scientific judgment and execution. You will work cross-functionally with engineers from AV Labs and partner engineering teams which enables Uber’s mission of helping people go anywhere and get anything and earn their way.\n\nWhat You Will Do:\n• Design and implement cutting-edge techniques for autonomous vehicle systems.\n• Collaborate closely with engineering teams and product teams across AV Labs to integrate modeling approaches into production pipelines.\n• Publish and present original research at top-tier CV and ML conferences.\n\nBasic Qualifications:\n• PhD or MS with equivalent industry experience in Computer Science, Robotics, or a related field.\n• Relevant experience in autonomous vehicles or computer vision, with a strong understanding of how research ideas connect to autonomous vehicle systems.\n• Demonstrated technical contributions, including publications at leading ML and CV conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ICLR, NeurIPS, or similar venues.\n• Proficiency in Python and modern deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow; experience with C++ or deploying models in production environments is a plus.\n• Strong communication skills and the ability to collaborate effectively with researchers and engineers across teams.\n\nPreferred Qualifications:\n• Experience with autonomous vehicles research.\n• Hands-on experience in training multimodal LLMs for autonomous vehicle systems or relevant computer vision systems.\n• Recent publications in one or more of the following areas: 3D perception & scene understanding, multimodal embedding, diffusion models, gaussian splatting, vision language action models, and world models.\n• Experience with real-world product development and deployment.\n\nFor Sunnyvale, CA-based roles: The base salary range for this role is USD$171,000 per year - USD$190,000 per year.\n\nYou will be eligible to participate in Uber's bonus program, and may be offered an equity award & other types of comp.
