We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.\n\nOur work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.\n\nWhile many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment.

Your work will result in insights and recommendations that guide the team’s decision making.\n• Act as owner for a broad scope of data and metrics, from core logging to presentation of data visualizations.\n• Guide code reviews, provide SQL and Python expertise, and create well-maintained ETL jobs.\n• Maintain a high bar for statistical rigor on your team. Ensure that we’re conducting experimentation and causal analyses that build confidence with your stakeholders.\n\nWhat we look for in you:\n• A BA/BS in a quantitative field (ex Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) with ≥5+ years of relevant experience or a PhD in a quantitative field with with ≥3+ years of relevant experience\n• Demonstrated experience in driving impactful data science projects that tackle ambiguous problem spaces.\n• Ability to influence external stakeholders by synthesizing data learnings into compelling stories.\n• Practical expertise in applying complex modeling frameworks to practical business problems.\n• Professional experience using SQL and Python.\n• Experience working with digital products in an iterative development cycle.\n• Demonstration of our core cultural values: clear communication, positive energy, continuous learning, and efficient execution.\n\nDisclaimer: Applying for a specific role does not guarantee consideration for that exact position. Leveling and team matching are assessed throughout the interview process.\n\nID: P75788\n\nPay Transparency Notice: Depending on your work location, the target annual base salary for this position can range as detailed below. Full time offers from Coinbase also include bonus eligibility + equity eligibility + benefits (including medical, dental, vision and 401(k)).\n\nBase salary range shown. Total compensation also includes equity and bonus eligibility and benefits:\n$180,370—$212,200 USD\n\nPlease be advised that each candidate may submit a maximum of four applications within any 30-day period. We encourage you to carefully evaluate how your skills and interests align with Coinbase's roles before applying.\n\nCommitment to Equal Opportunity\n\nCoinbase is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer.
