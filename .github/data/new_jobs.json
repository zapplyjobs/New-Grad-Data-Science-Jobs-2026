At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco.

degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time. However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day. If you&#39;re ever unsure about a communication, don&#39;t click any links—visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;u data-stringify-type=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link c-link--underline&quot; href=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;http://anthropic.com/careers&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot; data-remove-tab-index=&quot;true&quot;&gt;anthropic.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;directly for confirmed position openings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we&#39;re different&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Corporate Operations team builds and defines how the company plans, forecasts, and makes operational decisions across teams, turning strategy into day-to-day execution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We sit at the center of the business and take on high-impact, often ambiguous problems that directly affect growth, efficiency, and how the business scales. That means deep-dive analysis, process re-design, and building pragmatic solutions that make the company run better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We work closely with senior leaders, move quickly, and focus on outcomes. This is a team for people who like solving hard problems, building and iterating, and leaving things better than they found them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Corporate Operations Analytics is embedded within this team and serves as the quantitative and analytical backbone for corporate planning. We build the dashboards, metrics, and tooling that power planning cycles, executive reviews, and day-to-day operational decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE JOB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We’re hiring a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Data Analyst, Corporate Operations&lt;/strong&gt; to support and scale Anduril’s corporate planning and operating cadence through high-quality analytics, visualization, and quantitative analysis. In this role, you will translate planning and operational questions into metrics, dashboards, and analyses that inform decision-making. You will be responsible not only for producing rigorous analytical work, but also for ensuring the analytics products you build are reliable, well understood, and continuously improving based on how they are used. This role is ideal for an early-career analyst who is technically strong, thoughtful about system design, and motivated to improve how data is used across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT YOU’LL DO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and maintain dashboards, scorecards, and analytical tools that track performance against plan and surface relevant risks, to be used in recurring planning and operating reviews&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Iterate on dashboards and analytical tools by incorporating feedback from users and evolving requirements as planning processes mature.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Perform quantitative analyses including forecasting, trend analysis, scenario modeling, variance analysis, and root-cause investigations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with data engineering and platform teams to define data requirements, validate data quality, and ensure analytical outputs are accurate and trusted.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Document assumptions, definitions, and methodologies to ensure metrics are understood and applied consistently across the organization.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1–2+ years of professional experience in an analytics-focused role (Data Analyst, Analytics Consultant, or similar).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Degree in a quantitative or analytical field (Statistics, Engineering, Data Science, Math) or equivalent practical experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong foundation in advanced analytics; ability to write Python, R, SQL, or other analytic languages&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience building business-facing dashboards and visualizations using tools such as Palantir Foundry, Looker, Tableau, Power BI, or similar is a plus&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated ability to work cross-functionally, aligning diverse stakeholders and driving outcomes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ability to thrive in a fast-paced ambiguous environment, balancing detail orientation with strategic judgment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Must be authorized to work in the United States&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;US Salary Range&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$86,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$114,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;The salary range for this role is an estimate based on a wide range of compensation factors, inclusive of base salary only.

    "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Mission Operations (MOPs) team is responsible for managing the execution, growth, and success of our customer accounts. Working across product, engineering, sales, and logistics teams, our Mission Operations Engineers own the customer relationships and develop, plan, and deploy Anduril products in support of their missions. They work side-by-side with customers to understand their specific problem sets and then shape Anduril’s offerings alongside our engineering teams to fit the mission needs. Because the problems we solve are uniquely challenging, our Mission Operations Engineers naturally gravitate toward finding solutions and are adept at navigating organizational hurdles. They are ultimately responsible for customer and mission success and therefore play a critical role in the shaping and future of Anduril Industries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Connected Warfare is one of Anduril&#39;s Business Lines focused on building a next-gen software-defined distributed C2 architecture focused on orchestrating and automating 3rd party combat-fielded sensors and strike-networks for synchronized joint operations. We work with mission partners and operators to deploy reliable and robust capabilities on operationally-relevant fielding timelines to meet complex challenges across the DOD and IC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE JOB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orchestrate the deployment of Anduril products.&lt;/strong&gt; Lead the planning and deployment of Anduril’s flagship hardware and software products in support of customer missions. Through collaboration with our engineering, logistics, and technical operations teams, Mission Operators are in charge of deploying our products to the field, training end users, and ensuring the high performance of our products. We are obsessed about engagement and keeping our finger on the pulse of how customers interact with our products. This helps us improve the user experience and evolve their operational tactics and techniques. And if something isn’t quite right, we work with product teams to quickly address the issue on behalf of our customer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grow your business through customer success.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to the operational and executive relationships you own, you will be responsible for meeting commercial targets that drive top line growth. This requires establishing committed and trust-based partnerships with our customers to not only help them solve their immediate problems, but also to foresee future opportunities where Anduril’s technology can make them more effective. Understanding Anduril’s value proposition and articulating how we can have an impact on a customer’s problem set, from the executive level to the end user, is critical to positioning Anduril for the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shape our products to meet mission needs.&lt;/strong&gt; Work side-by-side with our customers to understand their specific mission challenges and represent the customer as you work with Anduril engineers to shape products that solve critical national and international security challenges. Anduril engineers rely on Mission Operators to understand the lay of the land and bring a perspective that informs the product development process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate across nearly every Anduril team.&lt;/strong&gt; Successfully deploying our complex hardware and software products requires collaborating with nearly every internal Anduril team - business development, engineering, product, logistics, finance, legal, contracting, technical operations, and many more. You’ll be responsible for ensuring each party is engaged and informed, and will therefore become well-versed in what it takes to really bring the best of Anduril to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT WE&#39;RE LOOKING FOR &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mission First Mindset. &lt;/strong&gt;We put the needs of the mission and our customers first and understand that the US and its allies have no preordained right to victory in any future conflict. We actively seek out opportunities to better understand our customers’ mission needs, with a goal to build the best possible products for the warfighter and radically evolve our national and international defense capabilities. We push ourselves and the limits of our capabilities in the pursuit of this goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership Mentality.&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking for owners; those who have a natural bias to assume responsibility, a healthy dose of skepticism, and contribute to a culture of performance. We empower our Mission Operators to quickly assume high levels of responsibility and entrust them to actively own their account and shape its success. Our Mission Operators are just as comfortable helping to shape a proposal or pitch a new customer as they are working with engineers on new features or deploying products in the field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Aptitude and Intellectual Curiosity.&lt;/strong&gt; We are first and foremost a technology company, working at the leading edge of capabilities like machine learning, autonomy, distributed networking, and multi-modal sensor fusion. Do you have a natural desire to see beyond simple cause and effect relationships to really understand how complex systems operate? Do you actively seek out opportunities to educate yourself? These capabilities form the foundation of our product offerings, so we are looking for those who are comfortable communicating technical concepts and can articulate them in the context of the customer’s mission.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structured Thinker and Problem Solver. &lt;/strong&gt;Leading technical programs requires clear communication and well thought-out plans. We are looking for assertive communicators who bring a thoughtful perspective and honest dialogue. A solution-driven approach, the ability to distill complexity into its essential, digestible components, and the ability to supervise execution are critical to ensure mission success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Value Team Member. &lt;/strong&gt;Do you enjoy working as part of a team? At Anduril, the path to success weaves through the organization - account teams, engineering, logistics, technical operations, and more. It requires humility, an eagerness to learn, and empathy toward your fellow team member. We assume best intentions and empathize with customers just as we do with our colleagues. Can you develop rapport at both the user and executive levels? Do you enjoy sharing successes? We are a low ego group that promotes teamwork and collaboration to bring about success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;360 Degree Leader. &lt;/strong&gt;We are a flat, non-hierarchical organization with a matrix structure that is dynamic and evolving. We expect you to be self-aware enough to recognize your position of unstated leadership within the company. You should have a demonstrated ability to lead and influence people through both formal and informal constructs and in situations where there is lack of clarity across teams. Finally, we need people who identify gaps and breakdowns and solve them immediately, rather than point them out and step back. You should also seek 360 feedback to help inform your growth trajectory as a leader.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT YOU&#39;LL DO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Serve in a customer-facing Account Manager capacity, working directly with the Department of Defense to develop and deploy Anduril integrated hardware-software C2 products to meet customer and operational needs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own the delivery of contract deliverables to include the developing and implementing measures of performance and effectiveness, writing technical reports, and creating user engagement roadmaps&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design &amp;amp; implement user feedback loops to gather, triage, and prioritize requirements, feedback, issues, and challenges found through the employment of Anduril C2 products during training, exercises, and normal use within unit schedules.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Provide input to program and engineering teams to drive the development of product features and configurations that enhance or greatly improve efficiency of user workflows and employment of Anduril C2 products.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support engagement with other service components, Geographic Combatant Commands, and other Government organizations as required to integrate Anduril products laterally across United States Armed Forces customers for increased adoption.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop and contribute to a streamlined user feedback and engagement system, which include issue tracking, training sessions, refreshers, and focused preparation for large scale exercises and events.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in technical program/account management roles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience translating and decomposing highly technical concepts into operational requirements and performance specifications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in program management and product deployment roles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Secret/TS Clearance with SCI eligibility strongly preferred&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Willing to travel up to 50%&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience and familiarity with Joint intelligence, operational planning, targeting, and fires systems and workflows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with doctrinal, functional, and technical command and control concepts, processes, and principles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prior military or government acquisition and/or government contracting experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Direct experience in management consulting or product management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;US Salary Range&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$129,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$171,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;The salary range for this role is an estimate based on a wide range of compensation factors, inclusive of base salary only.

    "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ABOUT THE JOB&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Planning organization plays a critical role in driving operational outcomes by translating demand insights into precise production and procurement signals. Within this group, the Systems &amp;amp; Process team partners closely with Anduril’s Analytics team to build scalable workflows, ontologies, and data models that power planning excellence. We’re responsible for developing the digital twin of our operations—capturing demand, supply, manufacturing, and sustainment data in ways that drive real-time decision-making.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’re looking for a Planning Analyst who thrives at the intersection of digital and the physical hardware world. You’ll design and implement data models, workflows, and analytical tools that directly improve operational performance—enabling Anduril to plan more effectively at scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;WHAT YOU’LL DO&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Planning leadership and Anduril’s Analytics team to build secure, timely, and extensible ontologies for domains such as Supply Chain, Manufacturing, and Finance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop reporting and data applications that provide near real-time visibility into planning KPIs, including forecast accuracy, fill rates, and inventory turns.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conduct ad-hoc analyses on demand signals, inventory strategies, and supply risk, delivering insights that balance service levels with profitability.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Run scenario planning and sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of market or contract volatility on operational outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with Analytics engineers to generalize planning workflows and data products across Anduril’s production and sustainment organizations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Act as a subject matter expert for planning tools and systems, supporting upgrades, enhancements, and best practice adoption.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Become a trusted resource for leadership by helping them run their organizations more effectively through data-driven insights.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;3+ years of experience in an analytics-focused role (Analytics Engineer, Data Engineer, or Analyst/Consultant with strong supply chain or operations background).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have strong operational instincts and a track record of owning complex, ambiguous planning problems from start to finish.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You think strategically and execute tactically—you’re just as comfortable designing a planning framework as you are diving into the details of a late supplier PO.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You bring a data-driven mindset and can turn analytics into action; you know how to interpret demand signals, build plans, and communicate clearly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’re systems fluent, with experience working across ERP platforms (e.g., NetSuite, SAP, Oracle), and can partner effectively with technical teams to improve tooling.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You lead with cross-functional empathy—understanding the needs of engineering, product, deployment, and finance to align priorities and deliver business outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You’re comfortable with ambiguity and energized by building structure in environments that are scaling fast.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You are high ownership, low ego, and value results over credit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You anticipate friction before it happens and proactively work to prevent issues rather than react to them.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Demonstrated experience building and owning processes and ontologies in a fast-paced environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Expert-level SQL skills and proficiency in Python (or other programming languages).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with BI and analytics tools (Looker, Tableau, Power BI, Palantir Foundry, dbt, Redshift, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong ability to translate technical models into actionable insights for non-technical stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Self-starter mindset—you prioritize velocity and impact, delivering solutions that drive immediate value.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Eligible to obtain and maintain an active U.S. Secret security clearance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;US Salary Range&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$98,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$130,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;The salary range for this role is an estimate based on a wide range of compensation factors, inclusive of base salary only.

    "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anduril&#39;s Software Engineers excel at developing state-of-the art algorithms and software that solve scientific problems with real-world applications. Working in small innovative teams, our software engineers build solutions that make a difference. Our research endeavors don’t end once we’ve written a journal or conference paper describing our technology; rather, our work is complete when our technology has been deployed in mission-critical systems and our customers within government and industry are successful. As science fiction writer Arthur Clarke wrote, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Anduril is seeking talented “magicians” to join in our mission to expand the boundary of what’s possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT YOU WILL DO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the direction of a small team with your expertise and ideas&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prototype state-of-the-art software solutions in an agile development environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implement high-performance software spanning the spectrum from tactical systems to web applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use high-fidelity modeling and simulation environments, innovative analysis tools, and sound analysis techniques to quantify the benefit of our technology&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engage with our customers, to ensure successful outcomes for their mission-critical needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with all aspects of the software development lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Help your colleagues and customers understand what you’re doing and why&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bachelor&#39;s degree or equivalent education/work experience&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;C/C++, Python, and Matlab;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Big data/NoSQL/database technologies;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AngularJS, Node.js, Javascript, and full-stack web development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Software engineering: software design, algorithm implementation, and software analysis, testing, and optimization;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Machine learning: supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering, and classification;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Applied mathematics: differential equations, linear algebra, optimization, statistics, and random processes;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engineering: controls, estimation theory, and digital signal processing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Eligible to obtain and maintain an active U.S. Top Secret SCI security clearance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em data-stringify-type=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;We request transcripts as part of the early application process to understand your academic background and how your coursework supports the skills deemed critical for the role.

    "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anduril&#39;s Software Engineers excel at developing state-of-the art algorithms and software that solve scientific problems with real-world applications. Working in small innovative teams, our software engineers build solutions that make a difference. Our research endeavors don’t end once we’ve written a journal or conference paper describing our technology; rather, our work is complete when our technology has been deployed in mission-critical systems and our customers within government and industry are successful. As science fiction writer Arthur Clarke wrote, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Anduril is seeking talented “magicians” to join in our mission to expand the boundary of what’s possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT YOU WILL DO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the direction of a small team with your expertise and ideas&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prototype state-of-the-art software solutions in an agile development environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implement high-performance software spanning the spectrum from tactical systems to web applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use high-fidelity modeling and simulation environments, innovative analysis tools, and sound analysis techniques to quantify the benefit of our technology&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engage with our customers, to ensure successful outcomes for their mission-critical needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with all aspects of the software development lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Help your colleagues and customers understand what you’re doing and why&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;C/C++, Python, and Matlab;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Big data/NoSQL/database technologies;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AngularJS, Node.js, Javascript, and full-stack web development.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Software engineering: software design, algorithm implementation, and software analysis, testing, and optimization;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Machine learning: supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering, and classification;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Applied mathematics: differential equations, linear algebra, optimization, statistics, and random processes;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engineering: controls, estimation theory, and digital signal processing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Eligible to obtain and maintain an active U.S. Top Secret SCI security clearance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em data-stringify-type=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;We request transcripts as part of the early application process to understand your academic background and how your coursework supports the skills deemed critical for the role.

    "job_description": "&lt;div class=&quot;content-intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anduril&#39;s Software Engineers excel at developing state-of-the art algorithms and software that solve scientific problems with real-world applications. Working in small innovative teams, our software engineers build solutions that make a difference. Our research endeavors don’t end once we’ve written a journal or conference paper describing our technology; rather, our work is complete when our technology has been deployed in mission-critical systems and our customers within government and industry are successful. As science fiction writer Arthur Clarke wrote, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Anduril is seeking talented “magicians” to join in our mission to expand the boundary of what’s possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT YOU WILL DO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the direction of a small team with your expertise and ideas&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Prototype state-of-the-art software solutions in an agile development environment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implement high-performance software spanning the spectrum from tactical systems to web applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use high-fidelity modeling and simulation environments, innovative analysis tools, and sound analysis techniques to quantify the benefit of our technology&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engage with our customers, to ensure successful outcomes for their mission-critical needs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work with all aspects of the software development lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Help your colleagues and customers understand what you’re doing and why&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;C/C++, Python, and Matlab;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Big data/NoSQL/database technologies;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Software engineering: software design, algorithm implementation, and software analysis, testing, and optimization;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Machine learning: supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering, and classification;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Applied mathematics: differential equations, linear algebra, optimization, statistics, and random processes;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Engineering: controls, estimation theory, and digital signal processing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Eligible to obtain and maintain an active U.S. Top Secret SCI security clearance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em data-stringify-type=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;We request transcripts as part of the early application process to understand your academic background and how your coursework supports the skills deemed critical for the role.

By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Discovery team at Anduril is at the forefront of incubating and maturing high-potential, software-defined, AI-native offerings that meet the toughest, newest challenges across hardware, software, space, and cyber domains. We&#39;re the architects of mission autonomy and mesh networking, delivering scalable hardware solutions that meet some of the most urgent national security needs. By working hand-in-hand with elite teams in Perception, AI, Motion Planning, Hardware, Test Engineering, Space, Networking, and Vehicle hardware, we craft cutting-edge, end-to-end systems that redefine mission success.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE JOB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a DevOps Software Engineer on the Discovery team, you will solve a wide variety of problems involving networking, autonomy, systems integration, robotics, and more, while making pragmatic engineering tradeoffs along the way. Your efforts will ensure that Anduril products seamlessly work together to achieve critical outcomes. You are not a DevOps person who knows a little coding, you are a coder who knows CI/CD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You’ll work closely with software, data, and operations engineers to turn designs into working systems—streamlining development, improving performance, and keeping production stable as we scale. You’ll also collaborate with digital, manufacturing, and corporate technology teams across Anduril in a high-tech, fast-paced culture of innovation focused on solving real problems and delivering results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Above all, Software Engineers must be driven by a “Whatever It Takes” mindset—executing in an expedient, scalable, and pragmatic way while keeping the mission top-of-mind and making sound engineering decisions to deliver successful outcomes on-time and with high quality.

By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE TEAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Discovery team at Anduril is at the forefront of incubating and maturing high-potential, software-defined, AI-native offerings that meet the toughest, newest challenges across hardware, software, space, and cyber domains. We&#39;re the architects of mission autonomy and mesh networking, delivering scalable hardware solutions that meet some of the most urgent national security needs. By working hand-in-hand with elite teams in Perception, AI, Motion Planning, Hardware, Test Engineering, Space, Networking, and Vehicle hardware, we craft cutting-edge, end-to-end systems that redefine mission success.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE JOB&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a DevOps Software Engineer on the Discovery team, you will solve a wide variety of problems involving networking, autonomy, systems integration, robotics, and more, while making pragmatic engineering tradeoffs along the way. Your efforts will ensure that Anduril products seamlessly work together to achieve critical outcomes. You are not a DevOps person who knows a little coding, you are a coder who knows CI/CD.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You’ll work closely with software, data, and operations engineers to turn designs into working systems—streamlining development, improving performance, and keeping production stable as we scale. You’ll also collaborate with digital, manufacturing, and corporate technology teams across Anduril in a high-tech, fast-paced culture of innovation focused on solving real problems and delivering results.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Above all, Software Engineers must be driven by a “Whatever It Takes” mindset—executing in an expedient, scalable, and pragmatic way while keeping the mission top-of-mind and making sound engineering decisions to deliver successful outcomes on-time and with high quality.

We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system.

Closely monitor and predict the evolving capabilities of frontier AI systems, with an eye towards misuse risks whose impact could be catastrophic to our society\n\n 2. Ensure we have concrete procedures, infrastructure and partnerships to mitigate these risks and to safely handle the development of powerful AI systems\n\nPreparedness tightly connects capability assessment, evaluations, and internal red teaming, and mitigations for frontier models, as well as overall coordination on AGI preparedness. This is fast paced, exciting work that has far reaching importance for the company and for society.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe’re hiring a Data Scientist to help build, evaluate, and continuously improve mitigations that prevent extreme harms from AI systems. This role is for an experienced, highly autonomous individual contributor who can take ambiguous problem statements, structure rigorous analyses, and translate findings into actionable product and policy changes.\n\nThis position goes beyond “running evals.” You’ll help create mitigation intelligence and monitoring systems that enable OpenAI to detect issues early, measure effectiveness over time, and reduce both over-blocking (unnecessary friction) and under-blocking (missed harm).\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\n - Evaluate and improve mitigation systems, including classifiers and detection pipelines across domains (e.g., biosecurity, cybersecurity, and emerging risk areas).\n\n - Diagnose false positives and false negatives with deep error analysis, root cause investigation, and clear recommendations for mitigation adjustments.\n\n - Build monitoring and measurement frameworks to track mitigation effectiveness over time and across user segments and use cases.\n\n - Identify trends in over-blocking vs. under-blocking, quantify customer impact, and propose prioritized interventions.\n\n - Develop insights from customer feedback, complaints, and usage patterns to detect shifts in adversarial behavior and system failure modes.\n\n - Expand risk monitoring into new areas, including cybersecurity threats and model loss-of-control or sabotage scenarios, in partnership with domain experts.\n\n - Communicate results to technical and executive stakeholders with crisp narratives, decision-ready metrics, and clear tradeoffs.\n   \n\nYou might thrive in this role if you are:\n\n - An autonomous operator: you can take a problem statement and independently structure the analysis end-to-end.\n\n - Strong at executive-ready communication: concise, clear, and outcome-oriented.\n\n - Skilled in turning analysis into productable changes: you’re comfortable influencing across functions to drive mitigation improvements.\n   \n\n\nQUALIFICATIONS\n\n - Significant experience in data science or applied analytics in high-stakes domains (e.g., security, trust & safety, abuse prevention, fraud, platform integrity, or reliability).\n\n - Strong foundations in experimentation, causal thinking, and/or observational inference; ability to design robust measurement under imperfect data.\n\n - Fluency in SQL and Python (or equivalent) for analysis, modeling, and building monitoring workflows.\n\n - Experience building metrics, dashboards, and operational monitoring that meaningfully changes outcomes (not just reporting).\n\n - Track record of driving cross-functional impact with engineering, product, and research partners.\n\n - Cybersecurity data science experience (strong preference), including exposure to threat modeling, adversarial dynamics, abuse patterns, or security telemetry.\n\n - Experience with classifier evaluation, calibration, thresholding, and error analysis at scale.\n   Familiarity with detection systems in adversarial settings (e.g., evasion, distribution shift, feedback loops).\n\n - Trust & Safety experience is helpful, but not required.\n\n - Genuine interest in AI safety, alignment, and catastrophic risk prevention.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates. For unincorporated Los Angeles County workers: we reasonably believe that criminal history may have a direct, adverse and negative relationship with the following job duties, potentially resulting in the withdrawal of a conditional offer of employment: protect computer hardware entrusted to you from theft, loss or damage; return all computer hardware in your possession (including the data contained therein) upon termination of employment or end of assignment; and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential, and non-public information. In addition, job duties require access to secure and protected information technology systems and related data security obligations.\n\nTo notify OpenAI that you believe this job posting is non-compliant, please submit a report through this form https://form.asana.com/?d=57018692298241&k=5MqR40fZd7jlxVUh5J-UeA.

    "job_description": "Switch Careers Without Starting Over.\nIf you're coming from business, healthcare, education, operations, retail, QA, finance, or project management and you're thinking, \"I want tech, but I'm not sure I belong,” you're already closer than you think. Career changers often bring advantages that traditional grads don't: real-world accountability, communication skills, stakeholder awareness, and the ability to execute under pressure. What usually holds career changers back isn't intelligence—it's the lack of a structured path that converts potential into hire-ready proof.\nSynergisticIT is a unique blend of software development, specialized staffing, and an industry driven tech bootcamp. Since 2010, we've been dedicated to bridging the gap between top-tier companies and highly skilled tech professionals. Our dual focus allows us to support clients with exceptional talent in Java, Data Science, AI, and Data Engineering, while also helping jobseekers strengthen their expertise through targeted upskilling. Over the years, we've helped candidates secure roles at leading organizations such as Visa, Client, PayPal, Apple, Wayfair, Yum Brands, and hundreds of other innovative companies across the United States.\n\nWe're actively considering candidates for full-time client roles across software and data: entry-level programming, Java full stack, Java/Python development, DevOps automation, and data tracks (analytics, engineering, science, ML/AI). Our core focus remains Java/Full Stack/DevOps and Data/Analytics/Engineering/ML.\n\nThat's why a job oriented approach matters far more than a training-only course. Most bootcamps teach you concepts and then leave you to \"figure it out.” Career changers don't need more uncertainty—they need a program built around outcomes: strong foundational training, portfolio development, interview coaching, and job placement execution. SynergisticIT's Job Placement Program (JOPP) is a placement-first model designed to bridge that gap.\nIf you want to explore the program directly, here are the key links:\n• Job Placement Program (JOPP):\n• Java Job Placement Program\n• Data Science / Data Jobs Program\n• Event videos (OCW, JavaOne, Gartner):\n• USA Today feature\n• Contact form: https://www.synergisticit.com/contact-us/\n\nSynergisticIT since 2010 has supported candidates in landing full-time roles at large employers (often citing examples such as Google, Apple, PayPal, Visa, Client, Western Union, Wells Fargo, Banking, Client, Client, Wayfair, and more), with offers commonly reported in the $95k–$154k range based on role and stack. Career changers tend to do especially well when they combine their domain knowledge (finance, healthcare, ops) with strong tech execution—because employers love candidates who understand both \"the business” and \"the build.”\nWhy career changers struggle\nBootcamps are often designed for speed, not depth. They compress learning, skip fundamentals, and push people into shallow projects. Then graduates face interviews where employers ask:\n• Can you explain your architecture choices?\n• Do you understand data structures and complexity?\n• Can you debug under pressure?\n• Can you design APIs and handle edge cases?\n• Can you write SQL and interpret data correctly?\nCareer changers can absolutely win—if they're trained the right way. That's why SynergisticIT emphasizes deep skill-building aligned to interviews and production expectations, plus structured job placement support.\nA practical view of what roles are hiring (and what SynergisticIT focuses on)\nCareer changers often ask, \"Which roles should I target?” A realistic and employable set includes:\n• Entry-level software programming roles (backend or full stack)\n• Java full stack development roles (often enterprise-friendly)\n• Python/Java developer roles (broad compatibility)\n• DevOps/Cloud automation roles\n• Data roles: Data Analyst, BI Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist\n• ML/AI Engineer roles (when supported by solid fundamentals)\nWho this program is often ideal for\nCareer switchers tend to be a strong fit if they match any of these:\n• Professionals changing careers into tech who need structure and speed\n• Candidates who completed Udemy/Coursera/university bootcamps but still can't land interviews\n• People who can learn quickly but need real portfolio and interview readiness\n• Candidates with gaps, layoffs, or non-traditional resumes\n• International candidates navigating OPT/STEM timelines\nSynergisticIT candidates (often around 30%) join after trying other bootcamps or online courses and still not getting hired—because most programs optimize for \"learning completion,” not job placement execution.\nYour career-change advantage\nIf you've worked in another industry, you bring:\n• Business context (why the software matters)\n• Communication (working across teams)\n• Reliability (showing up, delivering)\n• Problem solving (real deadlines, real constraints)\nYour missing piece is usually: technical depth, modern tools, and interview confidence. That's where a job-placement-first pathway becomes the difference between \"I'm learning” and \"I'm employed.”\nIf you're serious about switching into tech, don't do it alone and don't do it randomly. Build a plan and follow it with support.\nCareer change truth: You don't have to start over—you have to start correctly.

    "job_description": "Fresh CS Graduate to Full-Time Offer: A Job Search Strategy That Respects Your Timeline.”\n\nFor students and professionals who recently graduated, the job search pressure is different. You’re not just looking for a great role—you’re racing a timeline. And when applications don’t convert to interviews, it can feel like you’re running out of runway. The key is to stop playing a volume game and start building a profile that hiring managers recognize as job-ready .\n\nSynergisticIT has supported candidates since 2010 , helping them land full-time positions with offers commonly ranging from $90,000 to $154,000 , based on role and skill depth. JOPP candidates have landed at companies such as Google, Apple, PayPal, Visa, Western Union, Wells Fargo, Intel, Citi, JPMC, Bank of America, Walmart Labs, AutoZone, Deloitte , and more. The program is designed to close the skills-to-employment gap —especially for candidates who need strong projects, interview readiness, and structured placement support.\n\nSynergisticIT supports hiring pipelines for roles including entry-level software programmers, Java full stack developers, Python/Java developers, data analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers . The primary focus areas are Java / Full Stack / DevOps and Data tracks (Analytics/Engineering/Science/BI) + Machine Learning/AI . This matters for OPT candidates because many employers want candidates who can contribute across multiple layers—backend + cloud + data + pipelines—rather than a narrow toolset.\n\nMany candidates come to SynergisticIT after trying other routes. around 30% of JOPP participants have already completed other bootcamps or online platforms like Udemy and Coursera , or university bootcamps, but still didn’t land jobs. The common reason: those programs often emphasize learning , but not placement execution —resume positioning, interview readiness, and employer-facing preparation.\n\nSynergisticIT also helps candidates navigate the employment journey with support for STEM extension processes, and guidance for H-1B and green card filing pathways through the employment lifecycle (actual sponsorship and filing depend on employer policy and role). If you’re on OPT, what you need is a program that aligns your skills with the positions employers are actively hiring for today—and that helps you move faster from preparation to interview to offer.\n\nIf you want to explore the program directly, here are the key links:\n• Job Placement Program (JOPP):\n• Java Job Placement Program\n• Data Science / Data Jobs Program\n• Event videos (OCW, JavaOne, Gartner):\n• USA Today feature\n• Contact: https://www.synergisticit.com/contact-us/\n\nIf your clock is moving and your applications aren’t converting, it’s time to switch from “more applying” to “better positioning.” Fill out the contact form and ask SynergisticIT which JOPP track aligns with your target role.\n\nPlease read our blogs\n\nWhy do Tech Companies not Hire recent Computer Science Graduates | SynergisticIT\n\nWhat Recruiters Look for in Junior Developers | SynergisticIT\n\nSoftware engineering or Data Science as a career?\n\nHow OPT Students Can Land Tech Jobs – SynergisticIT\n\nRemote\n\nAbout the Company:\nSynergistic it",

    "job_description": "About the Team\n\nOpenAI’s mission is to build safe artificial general intelligence (AGI) that benefits all of humanity. Achieving this requires bringing the world’s most exceptional talent under one roof to push the boundaries of what’s possible.\n\nOur Research Recruiting team plays a critical role in this effort. We are an embedded part of the research organization, working side by side with our research staff to deeply understand evolving priorities, build trust, and strategically shape the future of OpenAI’s talent.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nYou will own and execute long-term talent strategies to identify, engage, and recruit many of the world’s leading and emerging AI researchers, research engineers, and technical scientists working at the frontier of machine learning. This is not a traditional execution-focused recruiting role.\n\nYou will operate as a strategic partner to OpenAI’s research staff, helping define hiring priorities, shape search strategy, influence candidate evaluation, and guide hiring decisions that directly impact the direction and quality of our frontier-model research and fulfillment of our mission.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Partner directly with research and technical staff to define hiring priorities, shape search strategies, and anticipate future talent needs as technical roadmaps evolve.\n\n - Proactively identify and cultivate exceptional AI/ML research talent across industry, academia, and emerging labs, often before formal hiring needs exist.\n\n - Use market insights and candidate signals to influence hiring decisions, leveling, and compensation strategy for highly specialized research roles.\n\n - Serve as a trusted advisor throughout candidate evaluation and closing — helping leaders calibrate for research excellence, long-term potential, and organizational fit.\n\n - Collaborate closely with your sourcing partner to execute complex, high-impact searches in ambiguous or rapidly evolving technical domains.\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Significant experience recruiting within highly technical or specialized environments.\n\n - Deep interest in AI research and a desire to engage directly with global research communities.\n\n - Experience recruiting within highly technical or specialized environments such as ML/AI, distributed systems, infrastructure, scientific computing, or quantitative research.\n\n - Track record of leading complex, ambiguous technical searches from early talent mapping through close.\n\n - Experience navigating high-stakes negotiations with senior technical or research candidates.\n\n - Comfort operating in fast-moving environments where hiring priorities and role definitions may evolve over time.\n\nWorkplace & Location\n\nThis role is based in our San Francisco office and we aren’t considering remote applications at this time. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office with optional work from home on Thursdays and Fridays. We also offer relocation assistance to new employees.\n\nOur open-plan offices have height-adjustable desks, conference rooms, phone booths, well-stocked kitchens full of snacks and drinks, three in-house prepared meals daily, outdoor space for working and socializing, wellness rooms, private bike storage, and more.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates. For unincorporated Los Angeles County workers: we reasonably believe that criminal history may have a direct, adverse and negative relationship with the following job duties, potentially resulting in the withdrawal of a conditional offer of employment: protect computer hardware entrusted to you from theft, loss or damage; return all computer hardware in your possession (including the data contained therein) upon termination of employment or end of assignment; and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential, and non-public information. In addition, job duties require access to secure and protected information technology systems and related data security obligations.\n\nTo notify OpenAI that you believe this job posting is non-compliant, please submit a report through this form https://form.asana.com/?d=57018692298241&k=5MqR40fZd7jlxVUh5J-UeA. No response will be provided to inquiries unrelated to job posting compliance.\n\nWe are committed to providing reasonable accommodations to applicants with disabilities, and requests can be made via this link https://form.asana.com/?k=bQ7w9h3iexRlicUdWRiwvg&d=57018692298241.\n\nOpenAI Global Applicant Privacy Policy https://cdn.openai.com/policies/global-employee-and-contractor-privacy-policy.pdf\n\nAt OpenAI, we believe artificial intelligence has the potential to help people solve immense global challenges, and we want the upside of AI to be widely shared. Join us in shaping the future of technology.",

We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

    "job_description": "ABOUT US:\n\nNotion helps you build beautiful tools for your life's work. In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.\n\nIn-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE:\n\nYou'll own the quality bar for Notion AI products. You’ll work with product and engineering teams to build systems to define what “good” looks like, measure our progress, and drive changes to deliver reliable and high-quality AI experiences. Your work directly shapes how Notion's AI products behave for millions of users.\n\nThis isn't a traditional software engineering role. It’s an art & science role. You won't spend your days writing code. Instead, you'll focus on understanding and shaping how our AI products behave through context engineering, designing evaluation systems, and analyzing data. This team sits in our AI engineering team, working directly with engineering, product, design, and data.\n\nThis role is a unique blend of ops, strategy, and product thinking. Day to day, you'll live in production data, ship prompt fixes, run evals and, in effect, shape our quality strategy. As part of that you'll shape Notion's model strategy and work directly with frontier AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) to evaluate and launch new models.\n\nWe're looking for problem-seeking generalists interested in 0 → 1: curious people with high agency who thrive in ambiguous, fast-moving product areas. We're building a product, but also building a new function. You'll have real ownership from day one and help write the playbook as we scale.\n\n\nWHAT YOU'LL ACHIEVE:\n\n - Context engineering — Design, test, and iterate on system prompts, tool prompts, and context strategies that shape how Notion's AI products behave. Understand the nuances of how models respond to different context structures and use that knowledge to drive quality improvements directly.\n\n - Understand & debug — Live in production data: transcripts, logs, user feedback. Reproduce issues, identify root causes, and translate symptoms into actionable problem statements. Find signal in noisy data.\n\n - Build evals & Measurement — Design eval strategies, build datasets, run evaluations. Track quality over time. Identify issues before users do. Own the loop: define quality goals, create evals, test and improve\n\n - Evaluate and launch new models with leading research labs — Evaluate and launch models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others. Benchmark across dimensions: quality, latency, cost, edge cases. Help shape Notion's model strategy based on real data.\n\n - Drive quality priorities — Work embedded with eng and product teams to surface the most important issues. Own the quality narrative: severity, frequency, what to fix and why. Be the voice of quality in the room.\n\n - Build tooling & systems — Help manage AI observability and eval platforms (e.g., Braintrust). Build the playbooks and tools that enable all teams at Notion to build AI products.\n\n\nSKILLS YOU’LL NEED TO BRING:\n\n - Driver mentality — You treat problems as yours. If something's broken, it's your job to fix it, even if you didn't cause it. You have a bias to action.\n\n - Curiosity －You’re excited about exploring the “jagged frontier” of LLM capabilities and how AI products meet reality\n\n - Analytical instinct — Your first move is to look at data. You can find signal in noise.\n\n - Comfortable working with data — You can self-serve insights from large datasets, whether through SQL, coding agents, or other tools.\n\n - Clear communication — You can explain complex issues simply.\n\n - Experience with LLMs, prompting, or AI products\n   \n   \n\n\nNICE TO HAVE'S:\n\n - Backgrounds in engineering, product, data science, research, consulting\n\n - You've built something on your own to solve a problem — side project, startup, tool, whatever\n\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.\n\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.\n\nNotion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits. The compensation offered for this role will be based on multiple factors such as location, the role’s scope and complexity, and the candidate’s experience and expertise, and may vary from the range provided below. For roles based in San Francisco or New York City, the estimated base salary range for this role is $98,000 - $140,000 per year.\n\nBy clicking \"Submit Application\", I understand and agree that Notion and its affiliates and subsidiaries will collect and process my information in accordance with Notion's Global Recruiting Privacy Policy https://notion.notion.site/Notion-Global-Recruiting-Privacy-Policy-fc3eb4e829354a26a2bb6fd5e289b550?pvs=74 and NYLL 144 https://notion.notion.site/Ashby-AI-Bias-Audit-2b0efdeead05803bbbfae159ec86c528.\n\n#LI-Onsite",

    "job_description": "&lt;p&gt;P-187&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Databricks is radically simplifying the entire data lifecycle, from ingestion to generative AI and everything in-between. We’re doing it cross-cloud with a unified platform, serving over 10k customers, processing exabytes of data/day on 15+ million VMs, and growing exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Delta Live Tables team (DLT) is looking for recent PhD graduates.&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables&quot;&gt; Delta Live Tables&lt;/a&gt; (DLT) makes it easy to build and manage reliable batch and streaming data pipelines that deliver high-quality data on the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.databricks.com/product/data-lakehouse&quot;&gt; Databricks Lakehouse Platform&lt;/a&gt;. DLT helps data engineering teams simplify ETL (extract-transform-load) development and management with declarative pipeline development, automatic data testing, and deep visibility for monitoring and recovery. DLT optimizes pipeline execution by logical optimization through query transformations, and physical optimization such as instance type selection and vertical/horizontal autoscaling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as part of DLT, we have a new catalyst optimization layer, enzyme, designed specifically to speed up the ETL process and make declarative ETL computation possible by incrementally computing and materializing the intermediate results. Enzyme can create and keep up-to-date a materialization of the results of a given query stored in a Delta table. Enzyme does this by using a cost model to choose between a variety of techniques that borrow from traditional literature on the maintenance of materialized views, delta-to-delta streaming, and manual ETL patterns commonly used by our customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a part of the DLT team, there are opportunities to design and implement in many areas that leapfrog existing systems:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Query compilation and optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Distributed query execution and scheduling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vectorized engine execution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Resource Management&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Transaction coordination&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Efficient storage structures (encoding, indexes)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Automatic physical data optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What We Look For:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;PhD in databases or systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of database systems, storage systems, distributed systems, and performance optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Motivated by delivering customer value and influence&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Range Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Databricks is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices.

    "job_description": "About the Team\n\nThe Applied Foundations team at OpenAI is dedicated to ensuring that our cutting-edge technology is not only revolutionary, but also secure from a myriad of adversarial threats. We strive to maintain the integrity of our platforms as they scale. Our team is at the front lines of defending against financial abuse, scaled attacks, and other forms of misuse that could undermine the user experience or harm our operational stability\n\nThe Integrity pillar within Applied Foundations is responsible for the scaled systems that help identify and respond to bad actors and harm on OpenAI’s platforms. As the systems that address some of our most severe usage harms become more mature, we’re adding data scientists to help us measure robustly the prevalence of these problems and the quality of our response to them.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe are looking for experienced trust and safety data scientists to help us improve, productionise and monitor measurement for complex, actor- and sometimes network-level harms. A data scientist in this role will own measurement and metrics across several established harm verticals, including estimating prevalence for on-platform (and sometimes off-platform!) harm, and analyses to identify gaps and opportunities in our responses.\n\nThis role is based out of our San Francisco or New York office and may involve resolving urgent escalations outside of normal work hours. Many harm areas may involve sensitive content, including sexual, violent, or otherwise-disturbing material.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Own measurement and quantitative analysis for a group of severe, actor- and network-based usage harm verticals.\n\n - Develop and implement AI-first methods for prevalence measurement and other productionised safety metrics, which may necessarily include off-platform indicators or other non-standard datasets.\n\n - Build metrics that can be used for goaling or A/B tests when prevalence or other top line metrics are not suitable.\n\n - Own dashboards and metrics reporting for harm verticals.\n\n - Conduct analyses and generate insights that inform improvements to review, detection, or enforcement, and that influence roadmaps.\n\n - Optimise LLM prompts for the purpose of measurement.\n\n - Collaborate w/ other safety teams to understand key safety concerns and create relevant policies that will support safety needs.\n\n - Provide metrics for leadership and external reporting.\n\n - Develop automation to scale yourself, leveraging our agentic products.\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Are a senior DS with trust and safety experience that can drive measurement direction.\n\n - Have deep statistics skills, specifically around sampling methods and prevalence estimation of complicated problem areas (ideally activity- rather than content-based).\n\n - Have experience working with severe and sensitive harm areas like child safety or violence.\n\n - Are an excellent communicator, and have strong cross-functional collaboration skills.\n\n - Are capable in data programming languages (R or python, SQL).\n\n - (Ideally) have experience with AI harms or leveraging AI for measurement.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates. For unincorporated Los Angeles County workers: we reasonably believe that criminal history may have a direct, adverse and negative relationship with the following job duties, potentially resulting in the withdrawal of a conditional offer of employment: protect computer hardware entrusted to you from theft, loss or damage; return all computer hardware in your possession (including the data contained therein) upon termination of employment or end of assignment; and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential, and non-public information. In addition, job duties require access to secure and protected information technology systems and related data security obligations.\n\nTo notify OpenAI that you believe this job posting is non-compliant, please submit a report through this form https://form.asana.com/?d=57018692298241&k=5MqR40fZd7jlxVUh5J-UeA. No response will be provided to inquiries unrelated to job posting compliance.\n\nWe are committed to providing reasonable accommodations to applicants with disabilities, and requests can be made via this link https://form.asana.com/?k=bQ7w9h3iexRlicUdWRiwvg&d=57018692298241.\n\nOpenAI Global Applicant Privacy Policy https://cdn.openai.com/policies/global-employee-and-contractor-privacy-policy.pdf\n\nAt OpenAI, we believe artificial intelligence has the potential to help people solve immense global challenges, and we want the upside of AI to be widely shared. Join us in shaping the future of technology.",
