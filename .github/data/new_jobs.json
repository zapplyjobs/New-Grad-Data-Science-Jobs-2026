This isn&#39;t consulting from the outside — you&#39;ll be building alongside their engineers, prototyping agents that fit into real research pipelines, and developing the ecosystem-level tooling (MCP servers, benchmarks, reusable agent skills) that extends Claude&#39;s usefulness across the broader life sciences community. This role will be part of the founding Beneficial Deployments applied AI team focused on bringing more of life sciences closer to the frontier and be responsible for building with our partners.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Partner deeply with flagship life sciences research institutions — understand their scientific workflows end-to-end, build hands-on with their engineering teams, and help take projects from early exploration to production systems integrated into how they do science day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Develop reusable ecosystem infrastructure, like MCP servers for domain-specific data sources (genomics platforms, literature databases, experimental repositories), instruments, scientifically-grounded benchmarks, and agent skills that other institutions can adopt without starting from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Identify what&#39;s actually hard about deploying AI in life sciences (heterogeneous data, auditability requirements, the prototype-to-trust gap) and feed those findings back to product, engineering, and research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Create technical content and documentation that lets partners self-serve, so what works for one institution can scale globally without the same level of hand-holding.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Be a Good Fit If You Have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4+ years as a Software Engineer, Forward Deployed Engineer, or technical founder — with production experience shipping systems that real users depend on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Deep research experience in life sciences, biomedical research, or scientific computing. Bonus if you&#39;ve studied genomics, neuroscience, or drug discovery specifically and are comfortable getting deeply technical with academics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience building LLM-powered tools or applications: prompting, context engineering, agent architectures, evaluation frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Builder credibility from shipping production code as a software engineer, forward-deployed engineer, or technical founder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A scrappy mentality–comfortable wearing multiple hats, building from scratch, driving clarity in ambiguous situations, and doing whatever it takes to further the mission.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$280,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$320,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;About the teams&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our Reinforcement Learning teams lead Anthropic&#39;s reinforcement learning research and development, playing a critical role in advancing our AI systems. We&#39;ve contributed to all Claude models, with significant impacts on the autonomy and coding capabilities of Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5. Our work spans several key areas:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developing systems that enable models to use computers effectively&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Advancing code generation through reinforcement learning&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pioneering fundamental RL research for large language models&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building scalable RL infrastructure and training methodologies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enhancing model reasoning capabilities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We collaborate closely with Anthropic&#39;s alignment and frontier red teams to ensure our systems are both capable and safe. We partner with the applied production training team to bring research innovations into deployed models, and are dedicated to implement our research at scale.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic’s Audio team pushes the boundaries of what&#39;s possible with audio with large language models. We care about making safe, steerable, reliable systems that can understand and generate speech and audio, prioritizing not only naturalness but also steerability and robustness. As a researcher on the Audio team, you&#39;ll work across the full stack of audio ML, developing audio codecs and representations, sourcing and synthesizing high quality audio data, training large-scale speech language models and large audio diffusion models, and developing novel architectures for incorporating continuous signals into LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our team focuses primarily but not exclusively on speech, building advanced steerable systems spanning end-to-end conversational systems, speech and audio understanding models, and speech synthesis capabilities. The team works closely with many collaborators across pretraining, finetuning, reinforcement learning, production inference, and product to get advanced audio technologies from early research to high impact real-world deployments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have hands-on experience with training audio models, whether that&#39;s conversational speech-to-speech, speech translation, speech recognition, text-to-speech, diarization, codecs, or generative audio models&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Genuinely enjoy both research and engineering work, and you&#39;d describe your ideal split as roughly 50/50 rather than heavily weighted toward one or the other&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are comfortable working across abstraction levels, from signal processing fundamentals to large-scale model training and inference optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have deep expertise with JAX, PyTorch, or large-scale distributed training, and can debug performance issues across the full stack&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Thrive in fast-moving environments where the most important problem might shift as we learn more about what works&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively; audio touches many parts of our systems, so you&#39;ll work closely with teams across the company&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are passionate about building conversational AI that feels natural, steerable, and safe&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Care about the societal impacts of voice AI and want to help shape how these systems are developed responsibly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong candidates may also have experience with:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Large language model pretraining and finetuning&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Training diffusion models for image and audio generation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Reinforcement learning for large language models and diffusion models&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;End-to-end system optimization, from performance benchmarking to kernel optimization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GPUs, Kubernetes, PyTorch, or distributed training infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representative projects:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Training state-of-the art neural audio codecs for 48 kHz stereo audio&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developing novel algorithms for diffusion pretraining and reinforcement learning&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scaling audio datasets to millions of hours of high quality audio&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Creating robust evaluation methodologies for hard-to-measure qualities such as naturalness or expressiveness&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Studying training dynamics of mixed audio-text language models&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Optimizing latency and inference throughput for deployed streaming audio systems&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (&quot;OTE&quot;) range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Annual Salary:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-range&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;$350,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;divider&quot;&gt;&amp;mdash;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$500,000 USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education requirements: &lt;/strong&gt;We require at least a Bachelor&#39;s degree in a related field or equivalent experience.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Location-based hybrid policy:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, we expect all staff to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;About the role:&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you see what modern language models are capable of, do you wonder, &quot;How do these things work? How can we trust them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Interpretability team at Anthropic is working to reverse-engineer how trained models work because we believe that a mechanistic understanding is the most robust way to make advanced systems safe. We’re looking for researchers and engineers to join our efforts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;People mean many different things by &quot;interpretability&quot;. We&#39;re focused on mechanistic interpretability, which aims to discover how neural network parameters map to meaningful algorithms. Some useful analogies might be to think of us as trying to do &quot;biology&quot; or &quot;neuroscience&quot; of neural networks using “microscopes” we build, or as treating neural networks as binary computer programs we&#39;re trying to &quot;reverse engineer&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A few places to learn more about our work and team at a high level are &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxhhMTOTMDg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this introduction to Interpretability&lt;/a&gt; from our research lead, &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://colah.github.io/about.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chris Olah&lt;/a&gt;; a &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/episode/5UF79Uu94ia0fwC32a89LU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;discussion of our work&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/column/hard-fork&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hard Fork podcast&lt;/a&gt; produced by the New York Times, and this &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/research/engineering-challenges-interpretability&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; (and accompanying video) sharing more about some of the engineering challenges we’d had to solve to get these results.

In the short term, we have focused on resolving the issue of &quot;superposition&quot; (see &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Toy Models of Superposition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/toy-double-descent/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Superposition, Memorization, and Double Descent&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/may-update/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;May 2023 update&lt;/a&gt;), which causes the computational units of the models, like neurons and attention heads, to be individually uninterpretable, and on finding ways to decompose models into more interpretable components. Our subsequent &lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/mapping-mind-language-model&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; found millions of features in Sonnet, one of our production language models, represents progress in this direction. In our most recent work, we develop methods that allow us to build circuits using features and use this circuits to understand the mechanisms associated with a model&#39;s computation and study specific examples of multi-hop reasoning, planning, and chain-of-thought faithfulness on Haiku 3.5, one of our production models.” This is a stepping stone towards our overall goal of mechanistically understanding neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We often collaborate with teams across Anthropic, such as Alignment Science and Societal Impacts to use our work to make Anthropic’s models safer.

We want AI to be safe and beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers, engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working together to build beneficial AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Societal Impacts research scientist on the Models Research Pod, you&#39;ll close the loop between observing Claude&#39;s behavior and improving it at the model level. You&#39;ll use observational tools like Clio to analyze real-world usage patterns and build evaluations that&amp;nbsp; assess whether Claude provides safe responses aligned with its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution&quot;&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Strong candidates will have experience with machine learning systems and a genuine interest in societal impacts research. You should be adaptable and excited to contribute to evolving team priorities rather than coming in with a fixed agenda. The role is highly cross-functional, with regular collaboration across the fine-tuning, safeguards, policy, and interpretability teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re hiring at both junior and senior levels. Senior researchers should be comfortable doing hands-on technical work alongside helping set research direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibilities:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using observational tools like Clio to analyze real-world usage patterns and surface insights about how people interact with Claude.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Building and running evaluations to assess Claude&#39;s behavior across key dimensions of its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution&quot;&gt;Constitution&lt;/a&gt;, such as safety and quality of advice in high-stakes situations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partnering closely with fine-tuning, safeguards, policy, and interpretability teams to translate research insights into model improvements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generating insights about the societal impact of Anthropic&#39;s systems and using this understanding to inform company strategy, research priorities, and policy positions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sharing your work through research publications and external presentations, and developing tools and frameworks that make AI systems more understandable to policymakers, academics, and civil society.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be a good fit if:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have experience working with machine learning systems and are comfortable with technical infrastructure for interfacing with models.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have an interest in societal impacts research; prior experience in this area is a plus but not required.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re adaptable and collaborative, able to take direction and contribute to team priorities rather than needing to pursue a predetermined research agenda.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re skilled at writing up and communicating your results, even when they&#39;re null or unexpected.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You find it exciting to partner with colleagues across teams on large-scale projects where the whole company contributes to building and analyzing AI systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You have a background in machine learning, data science, or another technical field that involves generating insights from complex systems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re passionate about translating research insights into actionable recommendations for improving AI systems and informing policy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For senior candidates: you&#39;re willing to do hands-on work while also helping shape research direction, and you may be interested in management opportunities down the line.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2 class=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some examples of our work:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;text-accent-secondary-100 underline&quot;

However, some roles may require more time in our offices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Visa sponsorship:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We do sponsor visas! However, we aren&#39;t able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification.&lt;/strong&gt; Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed.&amp;nbsp; Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you&#39;re interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we&#39;re building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Your safety matters to us.&lt;/strong&gt; To protect yourself from potential scams, remember that Anthropic recruiters only contact you from&amp;nbsp;@anthropic.com&amp;nbsp;email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much in common with physics and biology as with traditional efforts in computer science. We&#39;re an extremely collaborative group, and we host frequent research discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to understand our research directions is to read our recent research. This research continues many of the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic, including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI &amp;amp; Compute, Concrete Problems in AI Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come work with us!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues. &lt;strong data-stringify-type=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;Guidance on Candidates&#39; AI Usage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Learn about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;c-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-stringify-link=&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/candidate-ai-guidance&quot; data-sk=&quot;tooltip_parent&quot;&gt;our policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for using AI in our application process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system.

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Available Location: Lisbon, Portugal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Department&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Sales Operations team at Cloudflare is the engine that powers our global go-to-market (GTM) strategy. We are responsible for the systems, processes, and insights that enable our sales teams to deliver security and performance to millions of internet properties. We bridge the gap between business strategy and technical execution, ensuring that our infrastructure scales as fast as our company does.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a detail-oriented and organized professional to help drive operational excellence within our GTM processes and systems. In this role, you will specialize in the &quot;Lead-to-Opportunity&quot; lifecycle, acting as a key partner to our Business Development Representatives (BDR) and Marketing stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Business Analyst, you will ensure that the handoff between Marketing and Sales is seamless. You will work to understand the &quot;as-is&quot; state of our lead routing and engagement processes, document the &quot;to-be&quot; vision, and ensure our BDRs have the tools they need to convert leads effectively. This is an exciting opportunity to build your career in a high-growth environment where your analysis will directly impact our pipeline generation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stakeholder Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with the Business Stakeholders: Serve as the primary operational partner for BDR leadership and Marketing Operations. Ensure their requirements for lead handling and campaign tracking are captured and understood.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support Decision Making: Help analyze options, outlining pros and cons to support stakeholders and leadership in making informed decisions about system changes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Backlog Management: Maintain the project backlog for the Lead to Opportunity domain, ensuring user stories regarding lead management are clear, prioritized, and ready for development.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis &amp;amp; Solution Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Lead Lifecycle Optimization: Map out current process flows for lead ingestion, scoring, routing, and conversion. Identify &quot;leaky bucket&quot; gaps where potential opportunities are dropped and propose efficient solutions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define Requirements: Write clear user stories for system enhancements that impact the top of the funnel (e.g., changes to Salesforce lead objects or Sales Engagement platforms).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Process Documentation: Create and maintain up-to-date documentation on how leads flow from Marketing systems into Sales hands, ensuring clear &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; are documented.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution &amp;amp; Quality Assurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive Readiness: Organize and support system demos and training specifically for BDRs to ensure they are ready to adopt new tools and workflows.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Validate Solutions: Test lead routing logic and system triggers to ensure leads are getting to the right person at the right time before changes are deployed.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;System Expertise: Develop a strong familiarity with the interaction between Marketing Automation (Marketo and other marketing applications) and Salesforce to identify data sync issues or conflicts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills &amp;amp; Qualifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Required Capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience: Proven experience working as a Business Analyst or in Sales/Marketing Operations.

You are comfortable navigating lead conversion paths and basic routing logic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Analytical Skills: Ability to capture process flows, identify inefficiencies, and document detailed requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Communication: Strong verbal and written communication skills. You can effectively explain system concepts to non-technical stakeholders and business needs to technical teams.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desirable Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Agile/Scrum methodologies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with high-growth SaaS environments.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with Sales Engagement Platforms (e.g., Gong, Outreach, SalesLoft).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Exposure to Marketing Automation platforms (e.g., Marketo, HubSpot) and how they integrate with CRMs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience with Lead Routing tools (e.g., LeanData)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Makes Cloudflare Special?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company.

Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers millions of websites and other Internet properties for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare.

Today, our scope has broadened to include stewardship of CDNJS, the open source Managed Components project, and a range of strategic initiatives focused on empowering developers with more control over data privacy and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At our core, we’re building new ways to help web application owners streamline development and accelerate growth on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are a tight-knit team, communicating &amp;amp; collaborating regularly.

On any given day, you might:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write a design document outlining your strategy to tackle a specific challenge.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ship a new feature that integrates multiple technologies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fix a bug affecting how our user experience renders.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can expect to work with a variety of languages and technologies including, but not limited to, TypeScript, Go, and Rust.
